  "editorial_intro": "There is no alarm on Saturday. You wake when you wake, and the morning stretches ahead of you with nothing in it but potential. This is when coffee becomes something more than fuel. It becomes the centrepiece of the only hours in the week that belong entirely to you.",
  "editorial_body": "You lie there for a few minutes after waking, listening to the sounds of the weekend. A bird outside. The distant hum of a lawnmower someone has started too early. No email notifications, because you turned them off last night and you will not turn them back on until Sunday evening. The ceiling looks different on Saturdays. Everything does.\n\nWhen you get up, you move slowly. The kitchen is not a staging area this morning — it is a destination. You fill the kettle out of habit even though the Arco Primo heats its own water. Old routines die hard, and besides, you might want a pot of tea later. You open the coffee cupboard and consider the options.\n\nDuring the week, you use the same bag until it is finished. Efficient, predictable, fine. But on Saturday you choose. There is the washed Ethiopian you bought at the farmers' market — light, floral, with a bergamot note you keep trying to pin down. There is the Brazilian medium roast from the local roaster, chocolatey and round and forgiving. And there is the special one, the small bag from that place in Copenhagen, saved for exactly this kind of morning.\n\nYou choose the Ethiopian. You weigh out eighteen grams on the small scale, watching the numbers settle. The Arco Preciso grinder accepts the beans with a low hum, and you adjust the dial two clicks finer than your weekday setting. Lighter roasts need the finer grind to develop their sweetness, and today you have the time to chase that sweetness.\n\nThe grind falls into the portafilter in a neat mound. You distribute with a few taps, tamp firmly and evenly, and lock it into the Primo. The machine has been on for twenty minutes — you turned it on when you first came downstairs, before you even opened the curtains — and the group head is thoroughly saturated with heat.\n\nYou watch the extraction. This is the part that weekday mornings do not afford. The first drops appear after four seconds of pre-infusion, dark and hesitant. Then the flow begins properly, a thin, steady stream that catches the light like honey. The colour shifts from near-black through deep brown to a pale amber, and you stop the shot just as the blonding begins.\n\nThe crema is thick and mottled. Tiger-striped, they call it, though you have never seen a tiger that colour. You carry the cup to the table where the newspaper is already spread — a physical newspaper, delivered to the door, because some pleasures cannot be digitised.\n\nThe first sip is everything you hoped. Bright and clean, with a citrus acidity that lifts the whole cup. Beneath it, a sweetness like raw honey. The bergamot appears on the finish, distant but unmistakable. You take a second sip and it shifts again, the temperature drop revealing a caramel note that was hidden in the heat.\n\nYou read the headlines. You turn the pages slowly, leaving coffee rings on the margins. The cup empties. You consider a second and decide that yes, this is a two-espresso morning. You return to the machine and this time you try the Brazilian, because Saturday is for contrasts.\n\nThe second shot is darker, rounder, less complex but deeply satisfying in a different register. You carry it back to the table and find the crossword. The morning has no agenda. The coffee is its own justification.\n\nBy eleven o'clock, the newspaper is read, the cups are rinsed, and the day has opened up into whatever it will become. But this first part — the slow part, the quiet part, the part with coffee and newsprint and nowhere to be — this is the part you will remember when Monday comes and the alarm goes off again.\n\nEvery week needs a morning like this. Not as a reward for the other six days, but as a reminder of what you are working towards: a life with enough space in it to drink coffee slowly.",
