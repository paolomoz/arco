            <h1>Every hotel room. Every campsite. Every train. Good coffee.</h1>
            <p>The Traveller Kit is a complete portable espresso setup that fits in a daypack and weighs under a kilogram. No electricity, no compromise, no more settling for whatever the hotel lobby is serving.</p>

      <p>The worst coffee most of us drink is the coffee we drink away from home. Not because we stop caring, but because we assume good espresso requires infrastructure — a countertop, a power socket, a machine that weighs more than a carry-on. The Traveller Kit disproves that assumption entirely. The Viaggio and Macinino together weigh less than a bottle of water. The hardshell case protects both in a rucksack, a suitcase, or the side pocket of a panniers bag. The workflow is simple enough to execute half-asleep in a mountain hut: grind your dose with the Macinino, load the Viaggio's chamber, add hot water from a kettle or a camping stove, and press. Sixty seconds later you have a shot with body, crema, and the flavour of whatever beans you packed. We have seen travellers use this kit on overnight trains in Europe, at beachside hostels in Portugal, and in the back of campervans parked somewhere in Scotland. The common thread is the same small satisfaction: the rest of the trip might be unpredictable, but the coffee never is.</p>
