            <h1>A better grind. A simpler morning.</h1>
            <p>The Arco Preciso's stepped dial makes finding your sweet spot easy and repeatable. Set it once, and every morning your dose is exactly the same -- no scales, no adjustments, no thinking.</p>

      <p>Fresh-ground coffee makes everything taste better. The Preciso makes fresh grinding feel effortless. Unlike stepless grinders where a tiny nudge changes everything, the Preciso uses a 40-step clicked dial that snaps into place -- find your setting once, and it stays there indefinitely. The conical burrs naturally produce a sweeter, more forgiving grind, which means your espresso tastes balanced even on mornings when you're not paying close attention. The compact design takes up minimal counter space, the 250g hopper holds about a week's worth of beans, and the quiet 600 RPM motor won't disturb the early morning calm. This is the grinder for people who want better coffee without adding complexity to the mornings they already enjoy.</p>

      <h2>Set the dial. Forget the dial.</h2>
      <p>The Preciso's stepped adjustment clicks into place and stays there. No drift, no daily adjustments. The conical burrs are forgiving, the hopper holds a week of beans, and the motor runs quietly. Your morning gains fresh-ground quality without gaining any new steps.</p>

            <p>I set the Preciso to step 14 three months ago and haven't touched it since. Every morning the same dose, the same grind, the same great espresso. It made fresh grinding feel as simple as using pre-ground -- but the coffee is worlds better.</p>
