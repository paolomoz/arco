            <h1>50 cups a day. Zero complaints.</h1>
            <p>The Arco Ufficio is built for offices that take coffee seriously. Dual commercial boilers, auto-dosing, self-cleaning cycles, and multi-user profiles -- reliable quality at scale.</p>

      <p>Bad office coffee is a morale problem disguised as a facilities decision. The Ufficio fixes it. Dual commercial boilers and a rotary pump deliver consistent espresso across 50 or more cups per day without performance degradation. The auto-dosing system means any team member can produce a quality shot without training -- load the portafilter, press the button, and the machine handles grind dose and extraction time. Self-cleaning cycles run on schedule, reducing maintenance to a weekly five-minute check. Multi-user profiles let individuals save their preferences, and the plumbed-in design eliminates tank refills entirely. Per-cup cost with quality beans runs under 20 cents -- a fraction of pod systems and an order of magnitude less than a daily cafe run. The ROI calculation isn't close.</p>

      <h2>The business case for better office coffee.</h2>
      <p>At 20 cents per cup versus 45 cents for pods or 4 euros at a cafe, the Ufficio pays for itself within 6 to 9 months for a team of 15. Self-cleaning reduces maintenance labour. Auto-dosing eliminates training requirements. Dual group heads handle peak demand without queues. This is a productivity investment, not just a perk.</p>

            <p>We replaced three pod machines with one Ufficio. Coffee quality went through the roof, monthly costs dropped by 40%, and the machine basically maintains itself. Our team of 20 goes through about 35 cups a day and it never misses a beat. Best facilities decision I've made.</p>
