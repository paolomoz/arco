  "description_long": "The Arco Studio honours the E61 group head — the most proven design in espresso — by pairing it with a modern heat-exchange boiler and meticulous material choices. The brass group provides exceptional thermal stability and a pre-infusion phase that naturally smooths extraction. Walnut side panels and chrome detailing give the Studio a presence that belongs in a kitchen as much as a workshop. The dual pressure gauges let you read boiler and brew pressure at a glance, making every shot a conversation between you and the machine.",
