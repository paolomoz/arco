      <p>Both are stepless grinders built for people who care about what ends up in the cup. The Filtro is optimised for filter brewing methods with a wider grind range and burr geometry tuned for clarity. The Preciso is built for espresso with the fine-resolution adjustment that espresso demands. Choosing between them depends on what you brew most.</p>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>The Filtro and Preciso are specialist tools, not competitors. The Filtro excels at filter grind consistency across a wide range of methods and is the better choice if pour-over or immersion brewing is your daily ritual. The Preciso excels at the surgical fine adjustments espresso demands. If you brew both espresso and filter regularly, many of our customers end up owning both — and that is not an upsell, it is genuinely the best solution.</p>
