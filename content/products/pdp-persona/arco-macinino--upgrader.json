  "description_long": "Your grinder matters more than your machine. If you're still using a stepped grinder, a blade grinder, or the built-in grinder from an automatic, the Macinino will transform your espresso overnight. Its 64mm Italian flat burrs produce a unimodal particle distribution that extracts more evenly and tastes cleaner than anything a conical or smaller flat burr can achieve. The stepless micrometric adjustment lets you dial in with a precision that stepped grinders simply can't match -- fine-tune your grind in micro-increments until your shot is exactly where you want it. Retention is under 0.5 grams, which means less waste and more consistency between doses. The 1400 RPM motor grinds a full dose in about 5 seconds, and the timed dosing feature makes it repeatable every time. If you've been blaming your machine for underwhelming shots, the Macinino might be the upgrade that actually solves the problem.",
  "use_case_headline": "The single upgrade that makes the biggest difference.",
  "use_case_body": "64mm flat burrs vs. your current conical or stepped grinder: more uniform particle size, more even extraction, more flavour clarity. Stepless adjustment for micro-fine dialing. Under 0.5g retention. The Macinino is the grinder upgrade that makes your existing machine perform like a different machine entirely.",
