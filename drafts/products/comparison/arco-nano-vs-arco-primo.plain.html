      <p>The Nano is the smallest electric espresso machine we make — designed to disappear into a kitchen and still deliver a proper shot. The Primo is compact by any standard, but gives you a full-sized portafilter and a workflow closer to what you would find in a cafe. The trade-off is counter space.</p>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>The Nano is a genuinely good espresso machine that happens to be very small. It does not taste like a compromise unless you are chasing latte art or want to grow into competition baskets. The Primo costs a little more and takes a little more space, but its 58 mm portafilter and better steaming make it the stronger foundation if you think your interest in espresso might deepen over time.</p>
