  "hero_subtext": "Arco machines are available from specialist retailers across the UK and from our online shop with free delivery.",
  "editorial_intro": "Buying an espresso machine is the sort of decision that benefits from seeing the thing in person. How much space does it take up? How does it feel to lock in the portafilter? What does the espresso actually taste like? We have built a network of UK stockists who can answer these questions properly, without pressure.",
  "editorial_body": "Arco is available in the UK through three channels: specialist retailers, our online shop, and our London showroom.\n\nOur specialist retailers are independent coffee equipment shops — the kind of places where the person behind the counter has an opinion on grind distribution and is happy to share it. We chose our UK partners for their knowledge and their honesty, not their footprint. You will not find Arco in department stores or electronics chains. That is deliberate. We believe the buying experience should be as considered as the product itself.\n\nThe current UK stockist network covers London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Bristol, Leeds, Glasgow and Brighton. Each stockist carries the full Arco range and offers demonstrations — either on the spot or by appointment, depending on the shop. If you are weighing up two models, most of our stockists will pull you a shot from each so you can taste the difference rather than imagining it.\n\nOur London showroom is in Shoreditch, which is convenient if you are in east London and worth the journey if you are not. The space is designed as a working kitchen rather than a retail floor: each machine sits on a proper countertop at the height you would use it at home, with a grinder beside it and fresh beans loaded. You can grind, tamp, and pull a shot yourself — under guidance if you want it, left to your own devices if you prefer. The showroom is open Tuesday to Saturday, ten until six. There is no obligation to buy, and the espresso is on us.\n\nFor online purchases, we offer the following:\n\nFree delivery to any UK address. Orders are dispatched within one working day and arrive within two to three working days via a specialist courier service. Machines are double-boxed and insured in transit.\n\nA 30-day returns policy. If the machine is not right for you — too large, too small, not quite the workflow you imagined — contact us within 30 days and we will arrange a free collection and full refund. Our return rate is below 3 per cent, which we take as a quiet compliment.\n\nTwo-year manufacturer's warranty on all products, plus an extended five-year warranty on mechanical components when you register your machine online. Registration takes two minutes and costs nothing.\n\nSpare parts guaranteed for a minimum of ten years after a model is discontinued. Every gasket, valve, switch and seal is available individually from our online shop. We also publish free maintenance guides — written and video — so you can carry out routine service yourself.\n\nUK-based customer support, staffed by trained baristas who use Arco machines at home. Available by email and phone, Monday to Friday, nine to five. When you call with a question about your Doppio's temperature, the person answering has a Doppio in their kitchen.\n\nA note on pricing. Arco products are priced in euros across Europe and converted to pounds sterling at the current rate for UK purchases. Prices on our UK shop page are displayed in GBP and include VAT. There are no additional customs or import charges — we handle all of that.\n\nIf your local area is not yet covered by a stockist and you would like to see Arco machines in person before buying, get in touch. We regularly attend specialty coffee events and trade shows across the UK, and we can let you know when we will be near you. Alternatively, the London showroom is always open for a visit — no appointment needed, just turn up.\n\nFor independent retailers interested in stocking Arco, our partner application form is available online. We are looking for shops that share our values: knowledgeable staff, honest advice, and a genuine love of good coffee. Size does not matter. Passion does.",
