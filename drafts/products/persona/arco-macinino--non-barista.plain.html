            <h1>Your first grinder. Better coffee from day one.</h1>
            <p>The Arco Macinino turns whole beans into perfectly ground coffee at the press of a button. Set it once and it remembers your dose -- no scales, no expertise, no stress.</p>

      <p>If you've never owned a grinder, the Macinino is the perfect place to start. Here's what you need to know: coffee tastes dramatically better when ground fresh, and the Macinino does that for you automatically. Fill the hopper with whole beans (any beans you like), set the grind and dose once using the simple adjustment dial and timer, and then every morning you just press the button. It grinds exactly the right amount, stops on its own, and you're done. No need to weigh, no need to measure, no need to understand particle size distribution. The 64mm flat burrs are the same quality found in professional-grade grinders, but the timed dosing and set-and-forget design mean you never have to think about it. Fresh-ground coffee is the single easiest upgrade you can make -- and the Macinino makes that upgrade effortless.</p>

            <p>I didn't know the first thing about grinders and honestly I was worried I'd mess it up. The Macinino took five minutes to set up and now I just press a button every morning. The difference in my espresso is honestly shocking -- I can't believe I was using pre-ground for so long.</p>
