            <h1>Espresso that goes where you go.</h1>
            <p>At 4.2 kg and smaller than a hardback book, the Arco Nano is the real espresso machine that's light enough for a suitcase and tough enough for wherever you're headed.</p>

      <p>Hotel espresso is terrible. Airbnb coffee is worse. The Nano changes that. At just 4.2 kg and 18 x 28 x 25 cm, it fits in a carry-on bag or the corner of a suitcase. The thermoblock heating means it's ready in seconds on any standard outlet, and the 1-litre water tank is easy to fill from any sink or bottle. It's built from stainless steel and aluminium -- materials that handle travel without denting or cracking. Whether you're spending a month in a rental apartment in Lisbon or a week at a cabin in the mountains, the Nano means you never have to settle for bad coffee again. Pack it once and you'll never travel without it.</p>

      <p>4.2 kg. Instant heat-up. Standard voltage compatibility. The Nano is built for people who refuse to compromise on coffee just because they're away from home. Slip it in your bag and bring your espresso standard with you.</p>

            <p>I packed the Nano for a three-week work trip to Portugal and it was the best decision I made. It weighs nothing, heats up instantly, and the espresso is leagues beyond anything the hotel offered. It now has a permanent place in my travel bag.</p>
