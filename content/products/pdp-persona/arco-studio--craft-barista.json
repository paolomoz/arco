  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Studio espresso machine with walnut accents, flow control paddle mid-adjustment during extraction, pressure gauge reading 6 bar during a declining pressure profile, precision scale beneath the cup showing real-time weight",
  "description_long": "The Studio is where Arco stops holding your hand. The saturated 58mm group head delivers thermal stability measured in tenths of a degree. The rotary pump feeds through an integrated flow control valve that lets you manipulate flow rate in real time -- ramp pre-infusion, hold pressure, decline through the tail of the shot. Dual stainless steel boilers (300ml brew, 500ml steam) are independently PID-controlled, and the built-in shot timer syncs with the pump so you're never guessing. The 3-litre tank supports reservoir operation or direct plumbing for zero-interruption workflows. At 18 kg, it's substantial enough for thermal mass, compact enough for a home counter. This is the machine you buy when you've stopped asking how to make espresso and started asking what espresso can become.",
