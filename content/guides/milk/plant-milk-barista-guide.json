  "hero_image_alt": "Four ceramic latte cups arranged in a row on a light marble countertop, each containing latte art poured with a different plant milk — oat showing a golden-tinted rosetta, soy with a crisp white tulip, almond with a slightly translucent heart, coconut with a bright white fern — small labelled pitchers beside each cup, overhead natural light casting soft shadows",
  "intro": "Plant milks have gone from niche request to default option in many specialty coffee shops. But each one — oat, soy, almond, coconut — is a fundamentally different liquid with its own protein structure, fat content, and sugar profile. What works for steaming dairy or oat milk will fail with almond. The latte art technique that produces a clean rosetta in soy will collapse in coconut. This guide covers the specific behaviour of each major plant milk, with practical steaming adjustments and pouring tips so you can produce beautiful, consistent milk drinks regardless of which carton you reach for.",

      "heading": "Why Every Plant Milk Behaves Differently",
      "content": "Dairy milk has a consistent, predictable composition: roughly 3.3 percent protein (a mix of casein and whey), 3.5 percent fat (naturally emulsified butterfat), and 4.8 percent lactose, all suspended in a stable emulsion that has been optimised by biology over millennia. Every aspect of traditional steaming technique — the stretching chirp, the texturing vortex, the target temperature, the pouring speed — was developed around this specific combination of proteins, fats, and sugars. Plant milks are manufactured products with wildly different compositions. Oat milk's proteins are avenin and globulin derived from grain, suspended with added vegetable oil and stabilisers. Soy milk has the highest protein content of any plant milk — around 3 percent — from soy protein isolate, giving it the closest behaviour to dairy. Almond milk has very little protein (typically under 1 percent) and relies almost entirely on added emulsifiers and gums for any semblance of body. Coconut milk has high fat content from coconut cream but minimal protein, creating a rich mouthfeel with almost no natural foaming ability. These differences mean that the three pillars of milk steaming — bubble formation, bubble stabilisation, and heat tolerance — follow entirely different rules for each plant milk. Protein creates and stabilises bubbles. Fat adds body and mouthfeel but destabilises foam at high concentrations. Sugars determine sweetness perception at different temperatures. Emulsifiers and stabilisers added during manufacturing compensate for what the base ingredient lacks. Understanding these relationships for each milk type is the foundation of plant milk barista technique. You are not learning one skill and applying it four times — you are learning four related but distinct skills."

      "heading": "Oat Milk: The Closest to Dairy",
      "content": "Oat milk is the most forgiving plant milk to steam and the best starting point if you are new to plant milk latte art. Barista-edition oat milks (Oatly Barista Edition, Minor Figures, Califia Barista Blend) are formulated with added fat (typically rapeseed oil bringing total fat to around 3 percent), dipotassium phosphate as an emulsifier and acidity regulator, and gellan gum for stability. This combination produces a milk that steams into a workable microfoam with a creamy, slightly sweet character. Steam oat milk to 55 to 60 degrees Celsius — five degrees lower than dairy. The plant proteins denature and lose their bubble-stabilising ability above 60 degrees, causing the foam to thin out and develop a starchy, cooked-cereal taste. Stretch for one to two seconds only. Oat milk's proteins form weaker bubble walls than dairy's casein, so introducing too much air creates large, fragile bubbles that cannot be textured into stable microfoam. Keep the stretching phase brief and let the texturing vortex do the work of breaking bubbles down to micro size. The texturing phase is critical — maintain a strong, visible whirlpool for the entire duration to compensate for the weaker protein films. Pour immediately after steaming. Oat milk foam separates noticeably within 20 to 30 seconds, so there is no time for hesitation. Give the pitcher one firm tap on the counter and a vigorous swirl, then pour. For latte art, use a slightly higher pour position at the start (to push the crema aside) and then drop close to the surface for the pattern. Oat milk flows slightly faster than dairy due to its lower viscosity, so slow your wrist movements by about 20 percent compared to your dairy technique. Rosetta and tulip patterns work well with oat milk. Fine-line art like multi-layer rosettas requires excellent foam quality and fast execution before the foam degrades."

      "heading": "Soy Milk: The Best Protein, the Trickiest Temperature",
      "content": "Soy milk has the highest protein content of any widely available plant milk — typically 2.5 to 3.5 percent depending on the brand — which gives it the best natural foaming ability. Soy protein isolate creates strong, elastic bubble walls that can hold microfoam structure for longer than any other plant milk. In theory, soy should be the easiest plant milk to steam. In practice, it is the most temperature-sensitive and the most prone to curdling, which makes it rewarding for skilled baristas and frustrating for beginners. The curdling problem is soy milk's defining challenge in espresso. Soy proteins are highly susceptible to acid denaturation — when soy milk meets the organic acids in espresso (which typically has a pH of 4.5 to 5), the proteins coagulate and the emulsion breaks, producing visible clumps and a grainy texture. Three factors increase the risk: high espresso acidity (light roasts are more acidic), high milk temperature (heat makes proteins more vulnerable to acid), and pouring milk into espresso rather than espresso into milk (the initial acid concentration shock is higher). To minimise curdling, steam soy milk to no more than 60 degrees Celsius, use a barista-edition soy milk with added acidity regulators (such as Bonsoy, Alpro Barista, or Pacific Barista Series), and pour in a steady, continuous stream that integrates the milk and espresso gradually. Never let soy milk sit after steaming — the foam is stable but the liquid beneath becomes increasingly prone to curdling as it cools unevenly. Stretching soy milk can be slightly longer than oat — two to three seconds — because the stronger protein structure can support more air. The foam texture is closer to dairy than any other plant milk, with a glossy, paint-like surface when properly steamed. Soy milk produces the crispest latte art of any plant milk because of its superior protein film strength. Tulips hold their definition exceptionally well. Rosettas are clean and sharp. If your goal is Instagram-worthy plant milk latte art, soy is the medium to master. The flavour profile is more polarising than oat — soy has a distinct beany undertone that some people find unpleasant. Barista editions have reduced this significantly compared to standard soy milks, but it is still present. Soy pairs best with medium to dark roasts where the coffee's boldness complements the milk's nuttiness. With bright, fruity light roasts, the bean flavour can clash."

      "heading": "Almond Milk: Low Protein, High Difficulty",
      "content": "Almond milk is the most challenging plant milk to steam well because it has the least to work with. Standard almond milk contains as little as 2 percent almonds by weight, with the remainder being water, a small amount of added oil, stabilisers like locust bean gum or sunflower lecithin, and sometimes added calcium. The protein content is typically 0.4 to 1 percent — a fraction of dairy's 3.3 percent or soy's 3 percent. This minimal protein means almond milk has almost no natural ability to form or hold a foam structure. The bubbles that form during stretching pop almost immediately because there is not enough protein to create the elastic films that stabilise microfoam. Barista-edition almond milks (like Califia Barista Blend Almond or Alpro Almond Barista) improve this significantly by increasing the fat content, adding better emulsifiers, and sometimes incorporating a small amount of pea protein or other protein isolates to boost foaming ability. Even with these additions, almond milk produces the thinnest, least stable foam of the four milks in this guide. Steam almond milk to 55 to 58 degrees Celsius — the lowest target of any plant milk. Almond milk's scant proteins are extremely heat-sensitive, and overheating produces a distinctly bitter, astringent taste. Stretching should be minimal: one second at most, just a single brief chirp from the steam wand. Any more and you will create a layer of large, dry bubbles that sit on top of watery liquid — the opposite of microfoam. Focus almost entirely on the texturing phase, spinning a tight vortex to make the most of whatever small bubbles you managed to incorporate. Pour immediately and quickly. Almond milk foam has a useful life of roughly 10 to 15 seconds — less than half of oat milk's already short window. The foam is thin enough that it pours almost like water, so slow your pour rate significantly and keep the pitcher spout very close to the surface. Latte art is possible but limited. A simple heart or a small tulip is achievable with good barista-edition almond milk. Multi-layered patterns like rosettas are extremely difficult because the foam lacks the body to hold fine lines. The flavour of almond milk in espresso is light, slightly sweet, and nutty. It does not mask the coffee's character the way oat or soy can, which makes it a good choice for people who want to taste the espresso prominently. It pairs well with medium roasts and nutty, chocolatey flavour profiles. It struggles with very light, acidic roasts because — like soy — the almond proteins can curdle in highly acidic espresso, though the lower protein content means the curdling is less dramatic (more of a slight graininess than visible clumps)."

      "heading": "Coconut Milk: Rich Body, Minimal Foam",
      "content": "Coconut milk for coffee is not the thick canned coconut milk used in cooking — it is a diluted, shelf-stable blend of coconut cream, water, and stabilisers, typically containing 2 to 4 percent fat from coconut oil and less than 0.5 percent protein. This composition creates a unique steaming profile: excellent body and mouthfeel from the high fat content, but almost zero natural foaming ability from the near-absence of protein. Barista-edition coconut milks (like Alpro Coconut Barista or Sproud Coconut) add emulsifiers, sometimes supplemental protein from pea or rice sources, and stabilisers to improve foamability. Even so, coconut milk produces the least foam of any plant milk in this guide. The high fat content actually works against foam — fat globules destabilise bubble walls, which is why full-fat dairy foams less easily than skimmed dairy. Steam coconut milk to 55 to 60 degrees Celsius. It is less temperature-sensitive than almond or soy — the low protein content means there is little protein to denature — but overheating brings out an unpleasant cooked-coconut flavour and makes the already-thin foam collapse entirely. Stretching should be extremely brief: half a second to one second, barely a chirp. You are not trying to build a foam layer — you are trying to add just enough air to create a slight creaminess on top. Think of it as warm, aerated coconut cream rather than microfoam. The texturing vortex matters less here because there are so few bubbles to work with. Keep a gentle spin going to maintain homogeneity and prevent the fat from separating, but do not expect the glossy, paint-like surface you get with oat or soy. Latte art with coconut milk is the most limited of the four. A simple heart is achievable with practice and a good barista-edition product. Tulips and rosettas are extremely difficult bordering on impractical because the pour lacks the foam density needed to push patterns through the crema. Where coconut milk excels is in drinks where foam is not the priority. A coconut milk cortado or a short flat white benefits from the naturally rich, creamy mouthfeel without needing much foam structure. The sweet, tropical flavour pairs beautifully with medium and dark roasts, adding a distinctive character that many people love. It is less suited to light, fruity roasts where the coconut flavour competes with delicate origin notes. Coconut milk rarely curdles in espresso because its protein content is too low for significant acid coagulation — a practical advantage over soy and almond."

      "heading": "Pouring Latte Art: Adjustments by Milk Type",
      "content": "Latte art technique with plant milks requires adjustments to three variables: pour height, pour speed, and timing. Understanding how each milk responds to these variables will help you produce consistent art regardless of which plant milk you are working with. Pour height controls the initial integration of milk and espresso. With all plant milks, start higher than you would with dairy — roughly eight to ten centimetres above the cup — and pour into the centre of the crema for the first two-thirds of the cup volume. This high pour drives the milk beneath the crema and mixes it with the espresso, building the base layer. Because plant milks are generally less dense than dairy, a higher starting position helps them penetrate the crema rather than sitting on top. Pour speed should be slower for all plant milks compared to dairy, but the degree of adjustment varies. Oat milk flows approximately 20 percent faster than dairy at the same tilt angle because of its lower viscosity, so compensate by reducing your wrist tilt. Soy milk has the closest viscosity to dairy and requires the least adjustment. Almond milk pours very fast and thin — reduce your tilt significantly and pour in a controlled, gentle stream. Coconut milk is slightly thicker than almond but still thinner than dairy; moderate your speed accordingly. Timing is everything with plant milks because every plant milk foam degrades faster than dairy. From the moment you finish steaming, you are on a clock: soy gives you the most time (30 to 45 seconds of usable foam), oat gives you 20 to 30 seconds, almond gives you 10 to 15 seconds, and coconut gives you 10 seconds at best. Steam one drink at a time. Swirl, tap, and pour without delay. If you are making multiple drinks, steam each pitcher individually — batch steaming and sequential pouring will result in the second and third drinks having degraded foam. For the art pattern itself, drop the pitcher spout to within one centimetre of the milk surface when you are ready to lay the pattern — the same as dairy. Wiggle speed for rosettas should be slightly slower with oat and soy (the lower-viscosity milks spread patterns wider) and does not apply meaningfully to almond or coconut (stick to hearts and simple tulips). A firm, decisive cut-through at the end of the pattern is essential with all plant milks because the foam is less forgiving of hesitation. One confident stroke to finish; there is no going back to correct."
