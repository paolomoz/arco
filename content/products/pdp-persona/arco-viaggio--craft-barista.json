  "description_long": "The Viaggio is deceptively capable. Yes, it's a travel espresso maker. But its lever mechanism gives you something most electronic machines don't: true manual pressure profiling. You control the ramp -- slowly build to pre-infusion pressure, hold, then push through to full extraction at up to 9 bar, modulating decline by easing off the lever. With a good hand grinder and a precision scale, you can produce shots that rival machines ten times its size. The fine-grind basket accepts standard espresso-grind coffee (no proprietary pods required), and the stainless steel construction means brew temperature retention is excellent when you preheat with hot water. For the barista who already has a main rig, the Viaggio is the analog companion -- a tool that sharpens your feel for pressure and extraction in a way that electronic machines can't teach.",
  "use_case_headline": "A pressure profiling tool for your hands.",
  "use_case_body": "Full manual control from 0 to 9 bar. Pre-infusion by feel. Declining pressure by easing the lever. The Viaggio teaches you things about extraction that a pump and a PID never will. Pair it with a hand grinder and a scale for a portable precision setup.",
