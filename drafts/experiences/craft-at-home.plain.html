      <p>For you, making espresso is not a chore or a habit. It is a craft. You weigh every dose to the tenth of a gram, you log your shots in a notebook or an app, and you can taste the difference between a 25-second and a 28-second extraction. Your kitchen counter is not cluttered. It is curated. Every tool has a purpose, and every variable is under your control.</p>
      <p>The Craft at Home experience is built for dedicated home baristas who want to match or exceed the quality of their favorite specialty café. You are not interested in shortcuts or automation. You want the full hands-on experience: dialing in a new single origin, experimenting with pressure profiles, steaming milk to glossy perfection, and pouring latte art that would hold its own behind a commercial bar. Coffee is your creative outlet, and your equipment should never be the limiting factor.</p>
      <p>This curated setup puts professional-grade tools at your fingertips. The Arco Studio is our flagship machine, featuring electronic pressure profiling, saturated group head technology, and steam power that rivals commercial equipment. The Arco Zero grinder delivers the flat-burr clarity and zero retention that let you switch between coffees without wasting a gram. And the full accessory set, from precision scale to tamper to distribution tools, ensures that every step of your workflow is as intentional as the coffee you choose to brew.</p>
