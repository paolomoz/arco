  "comparison_intro": "The Ufficio is an espresso machine designed for shared environments where reliability, throughput, and simplicity matter more than fine control. The Studio Pro is a competition-grade home machine built for one person who wants to push every variable. Same price neighbourhood, completely different priorities.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Ufficio and Arco Studio Pro side by side, the Ufficio in a modern office kitchen with a row of cups waiting, the Studio Pro in a home coffee corner with a precision scale and notebook, split composition showing their different contexts, bright office light on left and warm home light on right",

      "recommended_product_id": "arco-studio-pro",

      "recommended_product_id": "arco-ufficio",
      "rationale": "If you are setting up a shared space and need something multiple people can use well, the Ufficio's forgiving design is the right call over the Studio Pro's demanding precision."
    }
  },
  "verdict": "These machines are not alternatives to each other \u2014 they solve different problems. The Ufficio is the right machine when multiple people need good espresso with minimal training and maximum reliability. The Studio Pro is the right machine when one person wants the best possible espresso and is willing to invest the time to achieve it. Buying a Studio Pro for an office is as misguided as buying an Ufficio for a home barista setup.",
