      <p><img src="https://content.da.live/paolomoz/arco/media/about-arco.jpeg" alt="The Arco workshop in northern Italy with engineers assembling espresso machines by hand" /></p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Arco was born in a small workshop in northern Italy, where a family of engineers shared a single obsession: building the perfect espresso machine. Not the most complicated machine, or the most expensive, but one that honored the craft of espresso by combining rigorous engineering with honest, lasting materials. That workshop is larger now, but the obsession has not changed.</p>
      <p>We believe that great espresso is an act of precision. Every component in an Arco machine, from the boiler to the group head to the drip tray, is designed, tested, and refined to serve a single purpose: helping you make the best coffee of your life. We do not add features for the sake of marketing. We do not chase trends. We build tools that work beautifully for years, tools that get better as you get better.</p>
      <p>Our approach to design draws from the Italian tradition of functional beauty. We believe that an object used daily should be a pleasure to look at and a pleasure to use. Our machines are made from stainless steel, brass, and hardwood, materials that age with grace rather than planned obsolescence. Every Arco product is designed to be serviced and repaired, because the most sustainable machine is the one you never throw away.</p>
      <p>Today, Arco serves home baristas in over thirty countries. Our product line spans from the compact Primo to the professional-grade Studio, with grinders, accessories, and portable equipment designed to meet every level of commitment and every style of coffee making. But no matter how much we grow, every machine still passes through the hands of the same team that built the first one. That is not nostalgia. It is quality control.</p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>

          <div>
            <h3>Precision</h3>
            <p>Every Arco product is engineered to tolerances measured in hundredths of a millimeter. We believe that precision in manufacturing translates directly to precision in the cup. Our PID controllers, pressure systems, and burr sets are calibrated to deliver repeatable results, shot after shot, year after year.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>We design for longevity, not replacement cycles. Our machines use durable materials, modular components, and readily available service parts. We minimize packaging, offset our manufacturing emissions, and partner with suppliers who share our commitment to responsible production. The greenest machine is the one that lasts a lifetime.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>Arco is more than a brand. It is a community of people who care deeply about coffee. We host workshops, publish educational content, and support local barista competitions around the world. We believe that sharing knowledge makes everyone's coffee better, and that the best ideas come from listening to the people who use our machines every day.</p>

      <h2>The Workshop</h2>

      <p>Our workshop sits at the foot of the Alps in the province of Treviso, a region with a long history of precision metalwork and a deep coffee culture. The facility houses our design studio, prototyping lab, assembly lines, and quality-testing station, where every machine is pulled through a series of extraction tests before it ships. Visitors are welcome by appointment. We believe in showing our work.</p>
