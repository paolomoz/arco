  "description_long": "The Automatico is the ideal office coffee solution for teams who want quality without complexity. Its built-in conical burr grinder uses whole beans for dramatically better flavour than pods, while the touchscreen interface means anyone can make their preferred drink -- from straight espresso to a milk-heavy latte -- without any training. The automatic milk system handles frothing and steaming, then cleans itself after each use. The 250g bean hopper and 1.8-litre water tank support a full morning's worth of drinks for a team of 8 to 12, and the self-cleaning cycle means maintenance is limited to a weekly rinse. Per-cup cost runs about 15 to 20 cents with quality beans -- roughly half the cost of pods and a tenth of the daily cafe run. No specialist knowledge required. No designated coffee person needed. Just consistently good coffee for everyone.",

Per-cup cost of 15 to 20 cents. Self-cleaning after every use. For teams of 8 to 12, it's the lowest-friction path to genuinely good office coffee.",
