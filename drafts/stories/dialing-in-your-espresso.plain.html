      <p>Dialing in is the process of adjusting your grind size, dose, yield, and extraction time to produce a shot that tastes the way you want it to. It is simultaneously the most frustrating and most rewarding part of making espresso at home. Every new bag of beans demands it. Every change in humidity or ambient temperature can shift it. But once you understand the underlying logic, dialing in becomes less of a mystery and more of a conversation between you and the coffee.</p>
      <p>Start with a fixed dose. For most home setups, 18 grams in a standard double basket is a reliable starting point. Weigh your coffee on a precision scale, distribute it evenly in the portafilter using a WDT tool or gentle tapping, and tamp with consistent pressure. Now pull a shot and time it. A good initial target is a 1:2 ratio, meaning 18 grams of coffee in and 36 grams of liquid out, in approximately 25 to 30 seconds. If the shot runs too fast, your grind is too coarse and you need to go finer. If it chokes or drips painfully slowly, you are too fine and need to open up.</p>
      <p>Once your time and yield are in the right neighborhood, taste the shot. Sourness and a thin, watery body usually indicate underextraction: try grinding finer or increasing your yield slightly. Bitterness, astringency, and a hollow or ashy finish point to overextraction: go coarser or pull a shorter shot. The sweet spot lives in between, where you taste the coffee's inherent character, its fruit, chocolate, caramel, or floral notes, supported by pleasant acidity and a smooth, lingering finish. A refractometer can give you an extraction percentage if you want to quantify things, but your palate is the ultimate judge.</p>
      <p>A few practical tips will speed up the process. Change only one variable at a time so you can isolate its effect. Keep a simple log of dose, grind setting, yield, time, and tasting notes. Purge a small amount of coffee through the grinder after each adjustment to clear stale grounds from the previous setting. And be patient with yourself. Even experienced baristas waste a few shots when opening a new bag. The goal is not perfection on the first try but a repeatable method that gets you to great coffee quickly and reliably.</p>
