  "editorial_intro": "The boxes are still stacked in the living room. The Wi-Fi is not set up yet. You ate dinner last night sitting on the floor with a fork and a takeaway container. But the coffee machine — that was the first thing unpacked. Because a place with good coffee in the morning is a home, and a place without it is just an address.",
  "editorial_body": "There is a particular feeling to the first morning in a place that is entirely yours. Not a shared house, not a student flat, not your parents' spare room. Yours. The keys are on the counter — your counter — and the fridge hums with its own particular pitch that you will come to know as well as your own heartbeat.\n\nThe kitchen is small and basic. The cabinets are that universal rental beige, the worktop is laminate, and the oven has a temperament you have not yet learned. But on the counter, between the kettle your mother gave you and the toaster you bought at the supermarket, stands the Arco Primo. It is the most expensive single thing you own in this apartment, and it is worth every penny.\n\nYou bought it with the money you had been saving in a separate account labelled, embarrassingly, COFFEE FUND. Three months of redirecting what you would have spent on takeaway espressos into a jar that grew slowly and then quickly enough to matter. The Primo was the machine you kept returning to in your research — capable enough to make properly good espresso, affordable enough not to empty the fund entirely, and compact enough for a kitchen that was never designed to accommodate ambition.\n\nThe Macinino grinder was a birthday gift from your father, who does not understand coffee but understands that you do, and who wrapped it in newspaper because he could not find the wrapping paper in the box room. It sits beside the Primo like a bookend, and the two of them together form the nucleus of what this kitchen will become.\n\nYour first espresso in the new apartment was not perfect. The grind was too coarse, the shot ran fast and thin, and the crema disappeared in seconds. You stood at the counter and drank it anyway, looking out the window at a street you did not yet know, and it tasted like possibility. The second shot, an hour later, was better. You adjusted the grind two clicks finer and the extraction slowed, thickened, developed a sweetness you recognised from the cafe near your old job. By the end of the first week, you were pulling shots that made you stop, mid-sip, and smile.\n\nThis is the learning curve. Nobody tells you that buying a coffee machine is really buying a new skill, a new daily practice that starts rough and smooths out over weeks and months. The Primo is forgiving enough to produce decent results while you learn and precise enough to reward you when you improve. It does not punish experimentation. It simply responds to your input, consistently and honestly, and lets you figure out the rest.\n\nThe apartment fills up gradually. The furniture arrives, the pictures go on the walls, the Wi-Fi starts working. But the coffee setup was there first, and it remains the fixed point around which the mornings organise themselves. You wake up, walk to the kitchen, and the Primo is there. The routine is the same whether the rest of the day is good or terrible, whether you have work or a day off, whether the flat is tidy or strewn with laundry.\n\nFriends come over and you make them espresso. Some of them have never had a properly pulled shot — their experience is limited to instant, filter, and whatever the office machine dispenses. You hand them a small cup and watch their expression change. That moment, the visible recalibration of someone's expectations, never gets old.\n\nOne friend asks what machine it is. You tell them. They say it looks expensive. You say it cost less than what you spent on takeaway coffee last year, and you watch the arithmetic happen behind their eyes.\n\nThe first apartment is temporary. You know this. In a year, or two, or three, you will move somewhere bigger, somewhere with more counter space and better light. The setup will grow — a better grinder, maybe a bigger machine. But the Primo will still be there, possibly relegated to the spare room or the office or given to a friend who is just starting out. It will still pull good shots. It will still be the machine that made the first apartment feel like home.\n\nFor now, it is enough. It is more than enough. It is yours.",
