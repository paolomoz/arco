  "description_long": "The Arco Studio Pro gives you the tools that define the best cafés in the world and puts them on your countertop. The saturated group head maintains temperature within ±0.5°C — tighter than most commercial machines. The flow control paddle lets you manipulate pressure in real time, opening up extraction profiles that were impossible on conventional home machines: long pre-infusions, declining pressure curves, blooming profiles for light roasts. Dual PID-controlled boilers, a digital pressure gauge, and shot-timer integration mean every variable is visible and adjustable. This is the machine you buy when you've decided espresso is a lifelong pursuit.",
