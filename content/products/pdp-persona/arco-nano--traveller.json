The thermoblock heating means it's ready in seconds on any standard outlet, and the 1-litre water tank is easy to fill from any sink or bottle. It's built from stainless steel and aluminium -- materials that handle travel without denting or cracking. Whether you're spending a month in a rental apartment in Lisbon or a week at a cabin in the mountains, the Nano means you never have to settle for bad coffee again. Pack it once and you'll never travel without it.",
