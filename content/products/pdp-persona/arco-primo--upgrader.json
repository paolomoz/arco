  "subheadline": "If your current machine leaves you wanting more, the Primo's commercial-grade 58mm group head and PID temperature control deliver the shot quality that entry-level machines simply can't.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Primo espresso machine in brushed steel on a dark marble countertop, a rich espresso shot with golden crema pooling in a clear glass, the machine's PID display glowing with a precise temperature reading",
  "description_long": "You've outgrown your first machine. Maybe the shots are inconsistent, or the plasticky portafilter never feels quite right, or you've started noticing temperature swings mid-pull. The Arco Primo solves all of that. Its PID-controlled thermoblock holds temperature within a degree of your target, the full-size 58mm group head accepts commercial baskets and accessories, and the 15-bar pump delivers a stable 9 bar at the group -- the pressure that actually matters. This isn't a lateral move. It's the step up that makes every shot noticeably, undeniably better.",
  "use_case_headline": "Why the Primo outperforms what you have now.",
  "use_case_body": "Commercial 58mm portafilter compatibility means better baskets, better accessories, and better extraction. PID temperature control eliminates the guesswork. And at this price point, the Primo gives you prosumer fundamentals without the prosumer price tag.",
