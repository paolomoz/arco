      <p>If you've been making pour-over or French press because espresso machines seem too involved, the Automatico will change your mind. It grinds whole beans fresh for every cup -- which is why it tastes dramatically better than pre-ground -- but does it all automatically. Pick your drink on the touchscreen, and the machine handles everything: grinding, tamping, extracting, and cleaning up after itself. The thermoblock heats up rapidly, so there's no warm-up wait. The 8 programmable drink options mean you can save your exact preferences and recreate them with a single touch every morning. This is the machine for people who want exceptional coffee without any of the process. Your morning stays effortless. Your coffee gets a serious upgrade.</p>

            <p>I was a pour-over person who didn't want the fuss of an espresso machine. The Automatico is genuinely easier than my pour-over was -- and the coffee is on another level. One button, fresh beans, perfect drink. It's my favourite thing in the kitchen.</p>
