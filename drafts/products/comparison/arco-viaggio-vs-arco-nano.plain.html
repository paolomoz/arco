      <p>The Viaggio is a fully manual, hand-powered espresso maker that weighs 340 grams and fits in a jacket pocket. The Nano is an ultra-compact electric machine that makes genuine espresso on a countertop. One goes anywhere. The other needs a plug but asks less of you.</p>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>These are not really competing products — they solve different problems. If you need espresso where there is no plug, the Viaggio is remarkable for what it achieves at 340 grams. If you want the smallest possible electric espresso machine for a permanent spot in your kitchen, the Nano delivers more consistency with less effort. Many of our customers own both.</p>
