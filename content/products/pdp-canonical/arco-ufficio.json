  "description_long": "The Arco Ufficio was designed for the place where most people drink the most coffee — the office. Its 2.5-litre water tank and dual-boiler system handle back-to-back shots without temperature drop, whether you're making five cappuccinos for a morning meeting or pulling espressos throughout the day. The commercial-grade group head and 58mm portafilter mean the coffee itself is indistinguishable from what you'd get at a good café. A removable drip tray, auto-off timer, and easy-access descaling mode keep maintenance straightforward even when no single person is responsible for the machine.",
