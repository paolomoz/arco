  "description_long": "The Arco Automatico is for people who love great coffee but have no interest in becoming baristas. Load whole beans into the hopper, fill the water tank, and touch the screen. The integrated ceramic burr grinder doses freshly ground coffee for every cup, the brewing system extracts at optimal pressure, and the automatic milk system produces microfoam that would satisfy a café owner. Seven pre-set recipes — from ristretto to flat white — can each be customised and saved to personal profiles. The Automatico's self-cleaning cycle runs daily, and descaling prompts appear when needed. It is, quite simply, the best coffee you can make without learning anything.",
