            <h1>A meditative morning ritual that fits in your hand.</h1>
            <p>Heat water. Add coffee. Press the lever. The Viaggio turns your morning espresso into a quiet, tactile ritual -- no machine, no electricity, no noise.</p>

      <p>There's something deeply satisfying about making espresso with your hands. The Viaggio strips the morning ritual down to its most elemental form: hot water, ground coffee, and the slow press of a lever. No buttons to press, no machines humming, no screens glowing. Just the quiet resistance of the lever, the steady build of pressure, and then -- a rich, concentrated espresso that you built entirely by feel. At 1.2 kg, it stores in a drawer or on a shelf, leaving your counter completely clear. Clean-up takes thirty seconds under running water. For the minimalist who wants their morning ritual to be intentional and physical, the Viaggio is espresso at its most honest.</p>

      <h2>Espresso at its most intentional.</h2>
      <p>Boil water. Load the basket. Press the lever slowly. The Viaggio takes about 90 seconds from start to finish, produces zero counter clutter, and cleans up in half a minute. It's the most calming way to start a morning.</p>

            <p>I sold my espresso machine and bought a Viaggio. No regrets. The silence, the simplicity, the feel of the lever in the morning -- it turned coffee from a task into a meditation. My kitchen counter has never been so clean.</p>
