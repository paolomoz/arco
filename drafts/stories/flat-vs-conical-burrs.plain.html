      <p>Walk into any specialty coffee forum and you will find the flat-versus-conical debate alive and well. Both burr geometries grind coffee. Both can produce excellent espresso. Yet they do so in fundamentally different ways, and understanding those differences can help you choose the grinder that best matches your palate and workflow. At Arco, we design grinders with both types, and the choice between them is one of preference rather than hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Conical burrs feature a cone-shaped inner burr that sits inside a ring-shaped outer burr. Coffee enters from the top and is pulled downward by gravity and the rotation of the inner cone. Because conical burrs can operate at lower RPMs, they generate less heat and less static, which means less retention and easier cleanup. The grind distribution produced by conical burrs tends to be bimodal, with a population of fine particles alongside coarser ones. This bimodal spread creates a complex, full-bodied cup that many espresso drinkers find rich and forgiving. Our Arco Preciso and Macinino grinders both use precision-machined conical burr sets.</p>
      <p>Flat burrs, by contrast, consist of two parallel rings with interlocking teeth. Coffee enters at the center and is flung outward by centrifugal force, passing between the burr faces before exiting at the perimeter. Flat burrs produce a more unimodal particle distribution, meaning the grounds are more uniform in size. This uniformity translates to clarity in the cup: individual flavor notes stand out with greater definition, and the shot tends to have a cleaner, more transparent character. The tradeoff is that flat burr grinders typically run at higher RPMs, generate more heat, and retain more coffee in the grinding chamber. Our Arco Zero grinder uses a large-format flat burr set with a low-RPM motor to capture the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>So which should you choose? If you favor body, sweetness, and a forgiving brewing window, conical burrs will serve you well. If you chase clarity, brightness, and the ability to taste terroir in every shot, flat burrs are worth the investment. And if you are the kind of person who owns both a wok and a cast-iron skillet, you already understand that the best tool depends on what you are cooking. The same principle applies here.</p>
