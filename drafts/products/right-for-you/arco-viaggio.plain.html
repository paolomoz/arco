            <h1>Is the Arco Viaggio right for you?</h1>
            <p>The Viaggio is a hand-powered espresso maker that weighs 340 grams and needs no electricity. It makes real espresso in places no electric machine can reach. But it asks more of you than any other product we sell, and honest expectations matter.</p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You travel frequently for work or leisure and refuse to accept hotel room coffee or airport espresso as your only options.</li>
        <li>You camp, hike, or spend time in places without reliable electricity and still want genuine espresso, not instant coffee.</li>
        <li>You are an experienced barista who appreciates the stripped-down physics of hand-pressure espresso and finds the process meditative rather than frustrating.</li>
        <li>You want something that fits in a jacket pocket, a backpack side pouch, or a carry-on toiletry bag without taking up meaningful space.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Not Ideal For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You have never made espresso before — the Viaggio requires you to generate consistent pressure by hand, heat water separately, and grind your beans with a hand grinder. The learning curve is steeper than any of our electric machines.</li>
        <li>You want milk drinks — there is no steam system of any kind. The Viaggio makes straight espresso and nothing else.</li>
        <li>You want a daily home machine — the Viaggio is capable of making a daily espresso, but the manual effort of heating water, hand-grinding, and pressing makes it a poor substitute for an electric machine when you have access to a power outlet.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div>
          <div>Does it really make espresso, or is it just strong coffee?</div>
          <div>It makes genuine espresso with crema. The physics are the same as a pump machine — water under 7–9 bar of pressure forced through finely ground coffee. The difference is that you are the pump. With practice, the output is remarkably close to a good electric machine. Without practice, it is strong coffee. The learning curve is about a week of daily use.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Is €89 a lot for what is essentially a tube you squeeze?</div>
          <div>The Viaggio is machined from surgical-grade stainless steel and designed to survive years of travel in bags, backpacks, and pockets. The engineering required to create a reliable manual pressure system at this size is non-trivial. Cheaper alternatives exist, but they are made from plastic and produce lower, less consistent pressure. You get what you pay for.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Should I just buy a portable electric machine instead?</div>
          <div>If you always have access to a power outlet, yes — the Nano is a better choice for hotel rooms and holiday rentals. The Viaggio exists for the genuinely portable use case: camping, hiking, train journeys, and places where electricity is not guaranteed. If your travel always includes a plug, the Viaggio is romantic but unnecessary.</div>
