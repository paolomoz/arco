            <h1>Is the Arco Studio Pro right for you?</h1>
            <p>The Studio Pro is the most capable home espresso machine we make. It is also the most demanding. Before you spend €2,199, we want to make sure this is the machine you need, not just the machine you want.</p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You have already used a machine with pre-infusion and want paddle-based flow control to shape the entire pressure curve of each shot.</li>
        <li>You compete in barista competitions at any level, or you prepare espresso with competition-level attention to extraction yield and consistency.</li>
        <li>You own (or will buy) a Zero-class grinder and a refractometer, and you actively use extraction data to refine your technique.</li>
        <li>You have been brewing espresso for two or more years and have a clear sense of what your current machine cannot do that you wish it could.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Not Ideal For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are still learning the basics of dose, grind, and extraction time — the Studio Pro's advanced features will overwhelm rather than help, and the Studio or Doppio will teach you more at this stage.</li>
        <li>You want fast mornings — the 10-minute warm-up requires planning, and the machine rewards slow, deliberate work, not rushed pulls.</li>
        <li>You are buying based on specifications rather than experience — the Studio Pro on paper is impressive, but its value only emerges when paired with advanced technique.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div>
          <div>Why not just buy a commercial machine at this price?</div>
          <div>A commercial machine at this price would be entry-level and designed for throughput, not single-shot precision. The Studio Pro is engineered for one or two cups at a time with maximum control — commercial machines optimise for a different set of problems. That said, if volume is your priority, look at the Ufficio.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Will I really use the flow control paddle?</div>
          <div>If you are asking this question, probably not yet. The flow control paddle is genuinely useful for advanced technique — reducing channeling on light roasts, extending pre-infusion for high-altitude beans, creating declining pressure profiles. But these are skills that build on years of manual brewing. If this is your first serious machine, start with the Studio.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Is the price difference from the Studio justified?</div>
          <div>The €900 gap buys you the flow control paddle, real-time pressure gauge, shot profiling capability, additional thermal insulation, and a larger steam boiler. If you will use at least the flow control and profiling, yes. If you are primarily paying for peace of mind that you bought the best, the Studio gives you 85% of the experience at 60% of the price.</div>
