  "description_long": "If your morning routine is a pour-over or a French press, the Filtro makes the one upgrade that matters most -- fresh grinding -- completely effortless. The 30-step clicked dial snaps into place and holds its setting permanently. Find your sweet spot once, and then every morning is the same: beans in, button press, grounds out. The compact design sits neatly beside your dripper or press, the 200g hopper holds enough for several days of brewing, and at 3.2 kg it barely takes up any counter space. The 48mm flat burrs are calibrated specifically for coarser grinds, so your pour-over and French press water flows evenly through a uniform bed of grounds. The result is a cleaner, sweeter cup -- every day, with no added effort. If you've been using pre-ground coffee for your filter brew, the Filtro is the simplest path to a noticeably better morning.",

  "use_case_body": "Clicked dial: set once, forget forever. Filter-optimised burrs: even grind for clean extraction. Compact footprint: sits beside your dripper. Fresh-ground filter coffee with exactly one new step in your morning.",
