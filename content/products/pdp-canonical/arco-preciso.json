  "description_long": "The Arco Preciso is the grinder that changes what you think home espresso can taste like. Its 54mm hardened steel flat burrs produce a remarkably uniform particle distribution, and the stepless micrometric adjustment collar lets you make changes so fine you'll taste them before you see them. Retention sits below 1 gram, meaning what you dose is what you brew — no stale grounds contaminating your next shot. The Preciso handles espresso with authority and manages filter grinds with clarity. It is the grinder for people who have outgrown steps and are ready for a continuous spectrum of flavour.",
