            <h1>When clients visit, the coffee says as much as the portfolio.</h1>
            <p>A professional impression, made one cup at a time.</p>

      <p>You work from home, and sometimes that means clients come to your home. The spare room is the studio, the dining table is the meeting space, and the impression you make in the first five minutes — including the coffee you serve — sets the tone for the entire relationship. A capsule machine says one thing. A properly pulled espresso says another entirely.</p>

      <p>The first client who visited your home office was a turning point. You had been freelancing for a year, meeting clients at cafes and co-working spaces, maintaining the illusion of an office that did not exist. Then a project got large enough that a studio visit made sense, and you had no choice but to invite them to your flat.

You spent the weekend preparing. The spare room was reorganised, the portfolio was printed and mounted, the dining table was cleared and set with notepads and pens. Everything looked professional. Then the client arrived, you offered coffee, and you realised that the options were a Nespresso machine with three stale capsule varieties or instant from a jar. You served the Nespresso. The client drank it without comment. But you saw the micro-expression — the small assessment, the fractional recalibration of expectations — and you understood that in a home office, every detail contributes to the professional impression.

The Arco Ufficio arrived the following month. It is, in the language of your profession, a statement piece. Brushed steel, clean lines, a commercial presence in a domestic setting. It sits on the sideboard in the hallway between the studio and the kitchen, and when clients arrive, it is one of the first things they see. Not prominently displayed — that would be try-hard — but visible, present, suggesting a certain standard.

Your coffee service is now part of the client experience. During the initial pleasantries, while coats are hung and seats are taken, you ask how they take their coffee. Espresso, cappuccino, long black — the Ufficio handles all three, and the Arco Studio-grade grinder built into it produces a fresh grind for each cup. The machine is quiet enough to operate while maintaining conversation, and fast enough that the pause feels natural rather than awkward.

You serve in proper cups. This matters more than it should, but it does. White porcelain, thin-walled, warmed on the machine's cup tray. A saucer. A small glass of water. These are small things, but clients notice small things. A client once told you, months into a working relationship, that the coffee at your first meeting was what convinced her you paid attention to detail. She was half joking. You were not.

The Ufficio's user profiles serve a different function here than in a shared flat. You have programmed three settings: a short, intense espresso for clients who know what they want; a longer, milder shot for those who prefer something gentler; and a profile optimised for milk drinks. You select discreetly based on the client's request, and the machine adjusts grind, dose, and temperature accordingly. The result is a consistently excellent cup, every time, regardless of the request.

The professional benefit is real but difficult to quantify. You cannot draw a direct line from a good espresso to a signed contract. But you can observe the way a meeting shifts when the coffee is good. Shoulders relax. Conversation opens up. The formality of a business meeting softens into something more collaborative, more human. The client is in your home, drinking coffee you made for them, and the intimacy of that exchange — domestic, personal, generous — changes the dynamic in ways that a meeting room and a paper cup never could.

You have also noticed that clients stay longer. In a cafe, a meeting has a natural endpoint — the coffee is finished, the table is needed, the noise level makes focused conversation difficult. In your home office, with the Ufficio ready to produce a second round, meetings extend into the productive territory where the real decisions happen. The second coffee is often more valuable than the first.

The cost of the setup is a business expense, fully deductible, and returns itself many times over in the impression it creates. But you did not buy it for the tax benefit. You bought it because you understood, after that first awkward Nespresso moment, that working from home is not an excuse for lower standards. It is an opportunity for higher ones.

The next client arrives in twenty minutes. The Ufficio is warming. The cups are on the tray. The water glasses are polished. And the first impression, before you show a single piece of work, will be a perfect double espresso in a white porcelain cup.

Some investments pay for themselves in revenue. Others pay for themselves in reputation. The Ufficio does both.</p>
