  "hero_image_alt": "An Arco Primo espresso machine on a narrow British kitchen countertop beside a kettle and a toast rack, subway tiles on the wall behind, a small window above the sink letting in morning light, a cup of espresso on a saucer next to a jar of marmalade, compact and lived-in kitchen atmosphere",
  "hero_headline": "Built for kitchens that measure in centimetres, not metres.",
  "hero_subtext": "British kitchens are famously compact. Arco machines are designed to deliver full-sized espresso from a footprint that respects your worktop space.",
  "editorial_intro": "The average British kitchen has roughly two and a half square metres of countertop. Between the kettle, the toaster, the knife block, and the fruit bowl, there is precious little room for a coffee machine. Arco was designed with exactly this constraint in mind.",
  "editorial_body": "British kitchens are not Italian kitchens. They are not the sprawling, marble-countered affairs of a Bolognese apartment or the open-plan showpieces of a Milanese renovation. They are, for the most part, compact, practical spaces shaped by terraced houses, Victorian conversions, and post-war building standards that prioritised quantity over square footage. The typical British kitchen worktop is sixty centimetres deep and often interrupted by a hob, a sink, and an awkward corner where the walls do not quite meet at ninety degrees.\n\nThis is the reality that any espresso machine must contend with if it wants to live in a British home. And it is a reality that most Italian and German machine manufacturers have historically ignored, designing machines for kitchens that simply do not exist in most British houses.\n\nArco takes a different approach. The Primo — our entry-level machine — has a footprint of 25 by 30 centimetres, smaller than a standard breadbin. It sits comfortably beside a kettle on even the narrowest worktop, and its height of 30 centimetres means it fits under wall-mounted cupboards without issue. The water tank is rear-loading, so you do not need clearance on the sides to refill it. The drip tray slides forward for emptying. Every dimension was considered from the perspective of a kitchen where space is measured in centimetres.\n\nThe Doppio and Studio are larger, but still designed with a consciousness of constraint. The Doppio's footprint is 28 by 38 centimetres — taller than the Primo to accommodate dual boilers, but no wider than a standard microwave. The Studio, our most traditional machine, is the largest at 32 by 42 centimetres, but its E61 group head extends forward rather than upward, keeping the total height below 40 centimetres and preserving clearance under overhead cabinets.\n\nBeyond dimensions, there are practical considerations that matter specifically in British kitchens. Water hardness varies dramatically across the UK — London and the South East have some of the hardest water in Europe, while Scotland and Wales tend toward soft. Hard water is the primary cause of scale buildup, which is the primary cause of espresso machine failure. Every Arco machine ships with a water hardness test strip and a guide to descaling frequency based on your results. For hard-water areas, we strongly recommend the Arco inline water filter, which fits between the reservoir and the machine's intake and reduces scale-forming minerals without stripping the water of the dissolved solids that contribute to good espresso flavour.\n\nElectrical compatibility is straightforward — all Arco machines sold in the UK come with a BS 1363 three-pin plug and are rated for 230V 50Hz. The heating elements are sized to draw under 13 amps, so they operate safely on a standard UK ring main without needing a dedicated circuit. The Primo draws 1200 watts, the Doppio 1450 watts, and the Studio 1400 watts — all well within the 3000-watt capacity of a standard UK socket.\n\nThe aesthetic question matters too. British kitchens tend toward a few recurring styles: the Shaker-inspired painted-wood kitchen, the Victorian-terrace kitchen with original tile and modern appliances, and the contemporary flat kitchen with handleless units and integrated appliances. The Arco range was designed to sit comfortably in all of these contexts. The Primo's clean lines and matte finish work in modern kitchens. The Studio's walnut panels and brass accents suit the warmer, more traditional British kitchen. The Doppio, in stainless steel with black detailing, bridges both aesthetics.\n\nWe do not design machines for showrooms. We design them for the space between your kettle and your toaster, in the kitchen where you actually live.",
