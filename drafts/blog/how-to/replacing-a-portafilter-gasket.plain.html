      <p>The group gasket is a small rubber ring that seals the connection between your portafilter and the group head. When it wears out, you get leaks, pressure loss, and inconsistent shots. Replacing it takes ten minutes, costs a few euros, and is one of the most satisfying maintenance tasks you can do at home.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>What the Gasket Does and Why It Wears Out</h2>
      <p>The group gasket sits in a groove inside the group head and creates an airtight seal when you lock in the portafilter. During extraction, the system is pressurized to nine bars — roughly 130 pounds per square inch — and the gasket is the only thing preventing that pressure from escaping at the junction between the portafilter and the group. It is a demanding job for a small rubber ring. Every time you lock and unlock the portafilter, the gasket compresses and releases. Over thousands of cycles, the rubber hardens, loses elasticity, and develops a permanent compression set — it no longer springs back to its original shape. Heat accelerates this degradation. The group head runs at brew temperature all day, baking the rubber slowly. Coffee oils and cleaning chemicals also affect the rubber over time, causing it to swell or crack depending on the material. A typical silicone group gasket lasts eight to twelve months of daily home use. If you pull four or more shots a day, you may need to replace it every six months. Commercial machines that run all day need new gaskets every three to four months. The good news is that the gasket is inexpensive and straightforward to replace, so there is no reason to wait until it fails completely.</p>

      <h2>Signs Your Gasket Needs Replacing</h2>
      <p>The most obvious sign is water leaking from around the portafilter during extraction. You will see drips or a thin stream of water seeping from the junction where the portafilter meets the group head. This means the gasket is no longer sealing properly and pressure is escaping. Your shots will taste under-extracted because the system cannot maintain full brew pressure. Another telltale sign is that the portafilter feels easier to lock in than it used to. When the gasket was new, you felt firm resistance as you turned the handle to the locked position. As the gasket compresses and thins, there is less material to grip the portafilter lugs, and the handle swings to the locked position with noticeably less effort. Some people compensate by cranking the handle further around, which works temporarily but eventually the gasket is too thin even for that. A subtler symptom is inconsistent shot pressure. If your shots are coming out faster than usual despite no change in grind size, dose, or beans, the gasket may be leaking enough to reduce effective brew pressure without producing visible drips. This is common in the late stages of gasket life when the seal holds most of the time but releases intermittently under full pump pressure.</p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Replacement</h2>
      <p>Start by letting the machine cool completely. The group head retains heat for a long time after shutdown, and you will be working close to it with your fingers. Give it at least thirty minutes, or run cold water through the group to speed cooling. Remove the shower screen by unscrewing the center retaining screw. Set the screen and screw aside. You should now see the old gasket sitting in the groove around the inside of the group head. Use a flathead screwdriver, a butter knife, or a purpose-made gasket pick to carefully pry the old gasket out. Work your way around the ring, levering gently. It should come out in one piece, though hardened gaskets sometimes crack and come out in fragments. If bits remain in the groove, pick them out with the screwdriver tip. With the old gasket removed, inspect the groove. Wipe it clean with a damp cloth to remove any residue or coffee oil buildup. Now take the new gasket — make sure it matches the correct diameter and profile for your machine. Arco machines use an 8.5mm cross-section silicone gasket across the Primo, Doppio, and Studio lines. Press the new gasket into the groove by hand, working around the circumference to seat it evenly. It should sit flush with no bulging. Reinstall the shower screen and screw, and you are done.</p>

      <h2>After Installation and Ongoing Care</h2>
      <p>After installing the new gasket, lock in the portafilter and check the resistance. It should feel snug and require moderate force to reach the locked position — firmer than the old gasket felt toward the end of its life. If it feels extremely tight, that is normal for the first few days; the gasket will conform to the portafilter lugs after a handful of lock-and-unlock cycles and a few heat cycles. Run a few water-only flushes through the group to seat the gasket and rinse away any manufacturing residue. Then pull a shot and discard it. The second shot should taste normal. To extend the life of your next gasket, adopt a few habits. Always remove the portafilter from the group when the machine is idle. Leaving it locked in compresses the gasket continuously under the weight of the portafilter, accelerating compression set. Clean the gasket surface during your weekly backflush routine — a quick wipe with a damp cloth removes oil buildup that degrades rubber. And when you descale, rinse thoroughly afterwards; residual citric acid can attack silicone over time. Keep a spare gasket in your accessories drawer so you are never caught without one. Arco sells them individually and in packs of three. At a few euros per gasket, it is one of the cheapest investments in consistent espresso quality you can make.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The group gasket creates a pressure seal between the portafilter and group head and wears out after eight to twelve months of daily home use.</li>
        <li>Visible leaks, reduced locking resistance, and unexpectedly fast shots are signs the gasket needs replacing.</li>
        <li>Replacement takes ten minutes: remove the shower screen, pry out the old gasket, seat the new one, and reassemble.</li>
        <li>Remove the portafilter when the machine is idle and wipe the gasket during weekly cleaning to extend its life.</li>
      </ul>
