            <h1>When your home machine can't keep up with your hospitality.</h1>
            <p>You love making espresso for guests, but your single-group machine wasn't built for parties. The Ufficio's dual groups and 50-cup daily capacity turn entertaining into a pleasure, not a bottleneck.</p>

      <p>You've been the home barista at every dinner party, pulling shots one at a time on a machine built for one person. The Ufficio changes the equation. With dual 58mm commercial group heads and a rotary pump designed for continuous use, it handles the post-dinner espresso round without breaking a sweat. Dual commercial boilers mean you're steaming milk on one side and pulling shots on the other -- simultaneously and indefinitely. The auto-dosing function means guests can make their own drinks when you want to step away from the bar. And with a 50-cup daily capacity, even your most ambitious gatherings won't push its limits. Yes, it's a commercial machine. But if you've outgrown everything in the prosumer category, the Ufficio is the logical -- and frankly exciting -- next step.</p>

      <h2>Prosumer performance meets commercial capacity.</h2>
      <p>Dual group heads mean two drinks at once. Commercial rotary pump means no recovery time between shots. Auto-dosing means guests serve themselves. If you've been wanting a machine that handles your lifestyle instead of limiting it, the Ufficio is the upgrade that actually matches your ambition.</p>

            <p>I went from a Profitec Pro 600 to the Ufficio and the difference when entertaining is night and day. Dual groups, no waiting, guests serving themselves with the auto-dose. My wife says the kitchen has become the best cafe in the neighbourhood.</p>
