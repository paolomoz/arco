            <h1>Is the Arco Preciso right for you?</h1>
            <p>The Preciso is the grinder we recommend most often to people who are serious about espresso but not ready to spend €700 on the Zero. It sits at a crossroads in the Arco range — capable enough to satisfy experienced baristas, accessible enough to grow into.</p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You own a Doppio or Studio and want a grinder that matches your machine's capability without becoming the limiting factor in your setup.</li>
        <li>You change beans every week or two and need stepless adjustment to dial in precisely for each new bag without being stuck between settings.</li>
        <li>You want to single-dose with minimal waste — the Preciso retains less than 0.3 grams, which means almost everything you put in comes out.</li>
        <li>You take espresso seriously but are not yet at the stage where you are measuring extraction yield with a refractometer and optimising particle distribution curves.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Not Ideal For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You pair it with a Primo or Nano — the Preciso's resolution exceeds what those machines can express, and the Macinino would serve you just as well at less than half the price.</li>
        <li>You are a competition barista or advanced hobbyist who can taste the difference between 54 mm and 64 mm flat burrs — the Zero's larger burr set produces a tighter particle distribution that matters at that level.</li>
        <li>You primarily brew filter coffee — the Preciso's adjustment range is optimised for the espresso end of the spectrum, and the Filtro is a better tool for pour-over and immersion methods.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div>
          <div>Is the Preciso worth double the Macinino?</div>
          <div>If you pair it with a Doppio or better, yes. Stepless adjustment, flat burrs, and near-zero retention solve the three biggest problems upgraders face: stuck-between-settings, uneven extraction, and bean waste. If you pair it with a Primo, the Macinino is sufficient. The grinder should match the machine.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Should I stretch my budget and get the Zero?</div>
          <div>Only if you already own a Studio or Studio Pro and have developed your palate to the point where grind quality is your primary remaining variable. The Preciso covers 90% of the Zero's capability at 43% of the price. The gap matters at competition level. For daily home use, the Preciso is the sweet spot.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Is stepless adjustment harder to use than stepped?</div>
          <div>It requires more intention but is not harder. Instead of turning to a number, you turn until the grind looks and tastes right. The first week you will overshoot adjustments. By the second week, you will find the collar's feel intuitive. Keep a pencil mark on your current setting and you always have a starting point.</div>
