  "comparison_intro": "Both machines share DNA \u2014 dual boilers, saturated group heads, and build quality that's built to outlast trends. The Studio Pro adds flow control, shot profiling software, and details borrowed from competition machines. Whether that matters depends entirely on how you brew.",

  "verdict": "The Studio is a genuinely professional-grade machine that most home baristas will never outgrow. The Studio Pro is for the small percentage of people who have outgrown pre-infusion levers and want paddle-based flow control with data logging. If you have to ask whether you need the Pro, you probably don't \u2014 yet. Start with the Studio and let your technique tell you when it is time.",
