      <p>The Ufficio is an espresso machine designed for shared environments where reliability, throughput, and simplicity matter more than fine control. The Studio Pro is a competition-grade home machine built for one person who wants to push every variable. Same price neighbourhood, completely different priorities.</p>

        <div>
          <div>not suitable for</div>
          <div>Anyone who wants to profile shots or micro-adjust extraction — the Ufficio is built for throughput, not tinkering</div>
          <div>Shared environments — the Studio Pro requires dedicated knowledge to operate and maintain, and its features are wasted on push-and-go usage</div>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>These machines are not alternatives to each other — they solve different problems. The Ufficio is the right machine when multiple people need good espresso with minimal training and maximum reliability. The Studio Pro is the right machine when one person wants the best possible espresso and is willing to invest the time to achieve it. Buying a Studio Pro for an office is as misguided as buying an Ufficio for a home barista setup.</p>
