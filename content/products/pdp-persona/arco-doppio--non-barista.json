  "description_long": "If you love lattes and cappuccinos but feel nervous about making them at home, the Doppio makes it genuinely approachable. The dual-boiler design means you don't need to understand temperature surfing or wait between steps -- just pull your shot on one side and steam your milk on the other. The steam wand is powerful enough to create silky microfoam, but forgiving enough that you'll get good results from your very first attempt. The E61 group head keeps temperature consistent so your espresso tastes the same every time, and the programmable timer means the machine is warm and ready when you wake up. You don't need to know what any of that means -- you just need to know that your morning latte will taste like it came from a cafe.",
