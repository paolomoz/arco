  "intro": "TDS and extraction yield are the two numbers that transform espresso from a sensory guessing game into a measurable science. TDS tells you how strong your coffee is. Extraction yield tells you how efficiently you dissolved flavor from the grounds. Together, they map onto a brew chart that reveals exactly where your shot sits — and where you need to move it to reach your target.",

      "heading": "The Math Behind Extraction Yield",
      "content": "Extraction yield (EY) is the mass of coffee solubles in the beverage expressed as a percentage of the dry coffee dose. The formula is: EY equals (beverage weight multiplied by TDS) divided by dose weight, multiplied by 100. All weights are in grams; TDS is expressed as a decimal. So a shot with 18 grams of coffee, 36 grams of liquid espresso, and a TDS of 10 percent gives: EY equals (36 times 0.10) divided by 18, times 100, which equals 20 percent. This means that of the roughly 5.4 grams of soluble material available in those 18 grams of coffee (assuming 30 percent solubility), you dissolved 3.6 grams — or about 20 percent of the total dry mass. The rest remained locked in the spent puck. Understanding this math clarifies why certain recipe changes work the way they do. Increasing yield (more water through the same dose) increases both the total dissolved mass and the EY — more water means more extraction. Increasing dose while keeping yield constant dilutes the extraction across more coffee mass, reducing EY. Grinding finer increases extraction rate per unit of time, raising EY for a given shot duration. Every recipe adjustment can be understood through this lens, which is why the math is worth internalizing rather than just plugging into a calculator."

      "heading": "Ideal Extraction Yield Ranges for Espresso vs. Filter",
      "content": "The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) published brew charts that define ideal extraction yield ranges based on extensive tasting research. For filter coffee, the sweet spot is an EY of 18 to 22 percent at a TDS of 1.15 to 1.45 percent — the so-called Gold Cup standard. For espresso, the picture is more concentrated but the extraction range is similar: an EY of 18 to 22 percent at a TDS of 8 to 12 percent. The higher TDS reflects espresso's nature as a concentrated beverage produced with less water and more pressure. Below 18 percent EY, shots tend to taste under-developed — sour, thin, and lacking complexity. The sugars, caramels, and body-building compounds that make espresso rich simply have not been dissolved yet. Between 18 and 22 percent is where most well-balanced, sweet, complex shots live. There is enough acid for brightness, enough sugar for sweetness, and enough body for a satisfying mouthfeel, with the bitter compounds still in check. Above 22 percent, the risk of over-extraction increases. Harsh, astringent, woody, and ashy compounds start to dominate. However, this threshold is not absolute. Some coffees — particularly well-developed light roasts ground on high-quality flat burr grinders — taste excellent at 23 or even 24 percent EY because the grinder produces a uniform particle distribution that extracts evenly without hot spots. The numbers are guides, not laws."

      "heading": "Dialing for a Target Extraction Yield",
      "content": "Once you know your target EY — say 20 percent — you can work backward to choose a recipe that hits it. The variables at your disposal are dose, yield (which together define the brew ratio), grind size, water temperature, and pressure profile. Start by fixing your dose (18 grams is a common choice) and choosing a starting ratio (1:2, or 36 grams out). Pull a shot, measure TDS, calculate EY. If EY is 17 percent (under your target), you need more extraction. Your options: grind finer to increase surface area and contact, increase yield to 40 grams (a 1:2.2 ratio) to send more water through the puck, or raise temperature by 1 degree to extract more aggressively. Each option has a different effect on TDS and flavor profile. Grinding finer increases EY and may also increase TDS because you extract more solubles in the same volume of water. Increasing yield increases EY but decreases TDS because the extra water dilutes the beverage. The flavor implications differ: a finer grind at 1:2 produces a stronger, more concentrated shot at the higher EY, while a 1:2.5 ratio achieves the same EY in a larger, less concentrated cup. Which you prefer is a matter of taste — the refractometer gives you the map, but your palate chooses the destination."

      "heading": "The Brew Chart and How to Use It",
      "content": "The brew chart is a two-dimensional graph with TDS on the vertical axis and extraction yield on the horizontal axis. Diagonal lines crossing the chart represent constant brew ratios — every point along a 1:2 line shares the same ratio of dose to yield. The ideal zone is a rectangle in the center of the chart, typically bounded by 8 to 12 percent TDS and 18 to 22 percent EY for espresso. Plotting your shots on this chart gives you a visual map of where you are and which direction to move. If your point is below the ideal zone (low EY), you need more extraction — move right on the chart. If it is above (high TDS but in-range EY), you might prefer a slightly longer ratio to dilute the strength without reducing extraction — move down the diagonal. If it is to the right of the zone (high EY, possibly over-extracted), pull back — coarser grind, shorter yield, or lower temperature. The beauty of the chart is that it separates strength from extraction. Many home baristas confuse the two: they think a strong shot is a well-extracted shot, or a weak shot is under-extracted. In reality, you can have a strong, under-extracted shot (tight ristretto with low EY) or a weak, over-extracted shot (long lungo with high EY). The chart makes these distinctions visible and actionable, turning what was once a vague sense of 'not quite right' into a specific, measurable adjustment."
