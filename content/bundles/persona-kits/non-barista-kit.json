  "editorial_body": "Let us be honest: most people do not want a hobby. They want a flat white at seven in the morning that tastes as good as the one from the cafe on the corner, and they want it without watching YouTube tutorials about extraction yield. The Non-Barista Kit respects that position entirely. The Automatico handles the entire process — grinding whole beans, dosing the right amount, extracting at the correct pressure, and texturing milk into genuine microfoam — behind a simple touchscreen interface. You choose your drink, you press the icon, you wait forty-five seconds. The result is not a compromise. It is a genuinely good cup of coffee produced by a machine that was engineered to make decisions you would rather not think about. The descaling subscription removes the last remaining point of friction: maintenance. Every three months a box arrives with exactly the solution you need, timed to the machine's usage cycle. You pour it in, run the programme, and you are done. No searching online for compatible products, no forgetting until the machine starts tasting strange. The Non-Barista Kit is not the lazy option. It is the efficient one.",
