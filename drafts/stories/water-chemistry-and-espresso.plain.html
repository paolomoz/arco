      <p>You have spent weeks dialing in your grind size, perfecting your dose, and timing every shot to the second. Yet something still tastes off. The culprit may be hiding in plain sight: your water. Making up over 98 percent of every cup, water is the single largest ingredient in espresso, and its chemical makeup has a profound effect on extraction, flavor clarity, and even the longevity of your machine.</p>
      <p>Total dissolved solids, or TDS, is the most commonly cited metric for water quality in coffee. The Specialty Coffee Association recommends a target of 150 parts per million, with an acceptable range between 75 and 250 ppm. But TDS alone tells only part of the story. The balance between calcium and magnesium ions, the alkalinity provided by bicarbonates, and the overall pH all interact to determine how efficiently your water pulls flavor compounds from the coffee bed. Magnesium, for instance, binds more readily to fruity and bright acids, while calcium tends to enhance body and sweetness.</p>
      <p>Hard water brings its own set of problems beyond taste. Scale buildup from excess calcium carbonate coats boilers, clogs solenoid valves, and reduces heat-transfer efficiency. Over time, this shortens the lifespan of even the most robustly engineered machines. On the other end of the spectrum, water that is too soft or too pure becomes corrosive, slowly dissolving copper fittings and brass components from the inside out. The sweet spot lies in a moderate mineral content paired with low alkalinity, a combination that extracts well and protects your equipment.</p>
      <p>The simplest path to great water is a purpose-built filtration system. Activated carbon filters remove chlorine and off-flavors, while ion-exchange resins reduce hardness. For the truly dedicated, remineralization recipes let you build water from scratch using distilled or reverse-osmosis water and precise amounts of magnesium sulfate and sodium bicarbonate. Third Wave Water and similar products offer pre-measured packets that take the guesswork out of the process. Whichever route you choose, treating your water is one of the highest-impact, lowest-cost upgrades you can make to your espresso routine.</p>
