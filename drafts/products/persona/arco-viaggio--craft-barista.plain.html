            <h1>Manual pressure. Full control. Pocket-sized.</h1>
            <p>The Viaggio's lever mechanism lets you control pressure ramp, peak, and decline by feel -- up to 9 bar, entirely in your hands. It's a manual profiling tool that weighs 1.2 kg.</p>

      <p>The Viaggio is deceptively capable. Yes, it's a travel espresso maker. But its lever mechanism gives you something most electronic machines don't: true manual pressure profiling. You control the ramp -- slowly build to pre-infusion pressure, hold, then push through to full extraction at up to 9 bar, modulating decline by easing off the lever. With a good hand grinder and a precision scale, you can produce shots that rival machines ten times its size. The fine-grind basket accepts standard espresso-grind coffee (no proprietary pods required), and the stainless steel construction means brew temperature retention is excellent when you preheat with hot water. For the barista who already has a main rig, the Viaggio is the analog companion -- a tool that sharpens your feel for pressure and extraction in a way that electronic machines can't teach.</p>

      <h2>A pressure profiling tool for your hands.</h2>
      <p>Full manual control from 0 to 9 bar. Pre-infusion by feel. Declining pressure by easing the lever. The Viaggio teaches you things about extraction that a pump and a PID never will. Pair it with a hand grinder and a scale for a portable precision setup.</p>

            <p>I use the Viaggio as a training tool. Controlling pressure by hand has made me a better barista on my main machine -- I understand extraction profiles physically now, not just on a graph. And the shots are legitimately excellent with a good hand grinder.</p>
