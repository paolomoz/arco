  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Ufficio espresso machine in matte black in a large open-plan kitchen during a gathering, dual group heads pulling shots simultaneously, guests mingling with espresso cups in hand, warm convivial atmosphere",
  "description_long": "You've been the home barista at every dinner party, pulling shots one at a time on a machine built for one person. The Ufficio changes the equation. With dual 58mm commercial group heads and a rotary pump designed for continuous use, it handles the post-dinner espresso round without breaking a sweat. Dual commercial boilers mean you're steaming milk on one side and pulling shots on the other -- simultaneously and indefinitely. The auto-dosing function means guests can make their own drinks when you want to step away from the bar. And with a 50-cup daily capacity, even your most ambitious gatherings won't push its limits. Yes, it's a commercial machine. But if you've outgrown everything in the prosumer category, the Ufficio is the logical -- and frankly exciting -- next step.",
  "use_case_headline": "Prosumer performance meets commercial capacity.",
  "use_case_body": "Dual group heads mean two drinks at once. Commercial rotary pump means no recovery time between shots. Auto-dosing means guests serve themselves. If you've been wanting a machine that handles your lifestyle instead of limiting it, the Ufficio is the upgrade that actually matches your ambition.",
