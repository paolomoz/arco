  "description_long": "The Studio Pro exists for the barista who's exhausted every variable on lesser machines. Its triple boiler architecture dedicates separate thermal systems to brew, steam, and hot water -- zero thermal interaction, zero compromise. The gear pump delivers electronically controlled pressure profiling: design your own curves on the 4.3-inch touchscreen, save them, share them via the IoT connection. Brew pressure is adjustable from 0 to 12 bar in real time, with repeatability measured in hundredths of a bar. The saturated 58mm group head provides the thermal mass and stability of commercial equipment. Firmware updates arrive over Wi-Fi. Brew logs sync to your phone for analysis. The plumbed-in option eliminates tank management entirely. This is the machine that turns your kitchen into a research lab -- and produces shots that rival anything coming out of a specialty cafe.",
