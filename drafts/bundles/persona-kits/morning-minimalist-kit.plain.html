            <h1>Everything you need for one perfect cup. Nothing else.</h1>
            <p>The Morning Minimalist Kit assembles the essentials for a quiet, repeatable espresso ritual in under four minutes. No clutter, no extras, no decisions — just the tools that earn their place on your counter.</p>

      <p>The morning minimalist does not want options. They want the right option, delivered without ceremony, every single day. This kit exists because the most common mistake new espresso buyers make is assembling their setup piecemeal — a machine here, a grinder three weeks later, a tamper that does not quite fit sourced from a marketplace at midnight. The result is friction where there should be flow. We assembled the Morning Minimalist Kit to eliminate that friction entirely. The Primo and Macinino were designed to complement each other: the grinder's stepped settings map cleanly to the Primo's forgiving brew temperature, so dialling in a new bag takes minutes rather than days. The included tamper is the same 58mm flat base that professional baristas use, weighted to encourage a level press without overthinking technique. And the cleaning kit means your machine stays in condition from day one, rather than slowly degrading until you notice something tastes off. Open the box, set up once, and your morning ritual is complete. The counter stays clean. The coffee stays consistent. The morning stays yours.</p>
