  "hero_image_alt": "A full English breakfast on a white plate — bacon, eggs, sausages, beans, toast, grilled tomato — on a wooden kitchen table, a double espresso in a small ceramic cup beside the plate, an Arco Primo espresso machine on the counter behind, Sunday newspapers scattered on the table, warm morning light through a kitchen window",
  "hero_headline": "The full English deserves better than instant coffee.",
  "hero_subtext": "Sunday morning is the one meal that defines British domestic life. An espresso from an Arco machine is the upgrade that breakfast has been waiting for.",
  "editorial_intro": "There is no meal more British than the full English breakfast. It is democratic, unapologetic, and deeply satisfying. For decades, the accompanying drink was builder's tea or a mug of instant coffee. The rise of home espresso has quietly changed that, and the pairing of a proper espresso with a Sunday fry-up turns out to be one of the great undiscovered food combinations.",
  "editorial_body": "The full English breakfast occupies a peculiar position in British culture. It is simultaneously a national institution and a guilty pleasure, a celebration of abundance and an act of mild defiance against every nutritional guideline published in the last forty years. On a Sunday morning, none of that matters. The ritual is the point: bacon in the pan, eggs cracking, toast browning, beans warming, the kitchen filling with the kind of smell that no scented candle has ever successfully replicated.\n\nFor most of the full English's history, the accompanying drink was an afterthought. Tea was the default — strong, milky, tannin-rich, serving primarily as a vehicle for hydration and warmth. Instant coffee was the alternative — functional, flavourless, added mainly because someone in the household preferred coffee to tea in the abstract, if not in practice. Neither drink was chosen for how it interacted with the food. They were just there.\n\nEspresso changes that equation. A well-pulled double shot — 18 grams in, 36 out, from a medium roast with body and sweetness — does something remarkable next to a plate of bacon and eggs. The bitterness of the espresso cuts through the richness of the fried food in the same way that a squeeze of lemon cuts through fried fish. The sweetness in the crema echoes the caramelised edges of the bacon. The body of the shot — that thick, syrupy quality that distinguishes espresso from every other form of coffee — matches the density and satisfaction of the meal itself.\n\nThis is not a food-pairing exercise in the precious, wine-sommelier sense. It is a practical observation: espresso and a fry-up are better together than either is alone, and the improvement is significant enough to justify rethinking how you make your Sunday morning coffee.\n\nThe Arco Primo is the ideal machine for this context. It heats up in ninety seconds — fast enough that you can switch it on when you put the bacon in the pan and have it ready by the time you plate up. The fifty-eight-millimetre portafilter produces a proper double shot with full crema. The footprint is small enough that it lives permanently on the worktop without displacing the toaster. There is no complicated programming, no app, no fifteen-minute warm-up ritual. You grind, tamp, pull, and drink. The shot is ready before the eggs are done.\n\nFor those who want milk with their breakfast coffee, the Primo's steam wand produces enough pressure for a small flat white or a macchiato — something to sip alongside the second round of toast while reading the Sunday papers. The Doppio, with its separate steam boiler, handles the dual task of shot and steam without any waiting, which matters on a morning when you are cooking for a household and do not have time to stand by the machine.\n\nThe Sunday full English is a weekly ritual in millions of British homes. It is one of the few meals that the entire household sits down for together, unhurried, with no schedule to keep and nowhere to be. Adding a proper espresso to that ritual does not make it more complicated. It makes it more complete. The bacon is still the star. The eggs still need to be cooked exactly the way each person likes them. The toast still needs to be buttered while it is hot. But the coffee — the coffee is no longer the weakest element on the table.\n\nArco does not make breakfast. But we make the machine that makes breakfast better.",
