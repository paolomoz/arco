      <p>Every home barista hits a stretch of bad shots. The espresso is sour, or bitter, or watery, or somehow all three at once. Rather than changing everything at random, this guide walks you through the most common problems, their likely causes, and the specific adjustments that fix them. Think of it as a diagnostic checklist you can return to any time your shots go sideways.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Problem: Sour, Thin, Acidic Shots</h2>
      <p>If your espresso tastes aggressively sour — like biting into an unripe lime — with a thin, watery body that feels more like tea than espresso, you are almost certainly under-extracting. The water has not dissolved enough of the coffee's sugars and body-building compounds; only the sharp organic acids have made it into the cup. The most common cause is a grind that is too coarse. Coarse particles leave large gaps in the puck, water flows through quickly, and extraction time is too short. Check your shot time: if it finishes in under 20 seconds, your grind is likely the culprit. Adjust one step finer and pull another shot. If shot time is in range but the shot still tastes sour, consider raising the brew temperature by one degree — higher temperature extracts more aggressively and will help dissolve the sugars you are missing. You can also try extending the yield slightly: instead of stopping at a 1:2 ratio, let it run to 1:2.2 or 1:2.3, giving the water a little more time to extract. Finally, check your coffee's age. Very fresh beans — less than five days off roast — contain high levels of CO2 that can interfere with even extraction. If you just opened a freshly roasted bag, let the beans rest for a few more days before dialing in seriously.</p>

      <h2>Problem: Bitter, Harsh, Astringent Shots</h2>
      <p>If your espresso tastes aggressively bitter with a dry, chalky, or woody aftertaste that coats the inside of your mouth, you are over-extracting. Too many of the heavy, unpleasant compounds have dissolved into the cup. The most common cause is a grind that is too fine. Very fine particles restrict water flow, extending the contact time and dissolving more solubles than you want. Check your shot time: if it is dragging past 35 seconds, grind one step coarser. If shot time is reasonable but the shot still tastes bitter, try lowering the brew temperature by one degree. Less heat means the water is less aggressive, reducing the extraction of those harsh late-stage compounds. You can also try a shorter yield — pull the shot to a 1:1.8 ratio instead of 1:2, cutting off the extraction before the unpleasant compounds accumulate. Over-extraction can also be caused by dark-roasted coffee. Darker roasts are more porous and soluble, so they extract faster and more easily than lighter roasts. If you have switched to a dark roast and your usual recipe produces bitterness, grind coarser, lower the temperature, or shorten the yield.</p>

      <h2>Problem: Channeling and Uneven Extraction</h2>
      <p>Channeling happens when water finds a weak spot in the puck and rushes through it instead of flowing evenly through the entire bed. The visual tell is dramatic: with a bottomless portafilter, you will see thin jets of espresso spraying sideways from the basket, or one side of the basket pouring fast while the other barely drips. The shot that results tastes simultaneously sour and bitter — the channeled path is over-extracted while the surrounding coffee is under-extracted. The root cause is almost always puck preparation. If grounds are unevenly distributed in the basket — piled higher on one side, or with clumps creating dense pockets — the denser areas resist water and the looser areas let it through. Fix this by distributing grounds thoroughly before tamping. Use a WDT tool (a set of thin needles) to stir and break up clumps, then level the surface before pressing. Tamping must also be perfectly level. A tilted tamp creates a thin side that water will exploit. Practice pressing straight down with a flat wrist. If channeling persists despite good puck prep, check your basket for damage — a bent or dented basket can create uneven resistance that no amount of distribution will fix.</p>

      <h2>Problem: No Crema or Very Pale Crema</h2>
      <p>Crema — the golden-brown foam layer on top of espresso — is formed by CO2 gas trapped in the coffee dissolving under pressure and then foaming as the liquid exits the portafilter into atmospheric pressure. If your shots have no crema or only a thin, pale, quick-dissipating layer, several things could be happening. The most common cause is stale coffee. Once beans are more than three to four weeks past their roast date, much of the CO2 has already escaped, and there is not enough gas left to form crema. Buy fresh coffee and use it within two to four weeks of roasting. A grind that is too coarse can also reduce crema, because the shot runs too fast and there is not enough emulsification. Very light roasts naturally produce less crema than medium or dark roasts because they are denser and contain less CO2. Machine issues can also play a role: if your brew temperature is too low or your pump is not delivering sufficient pressure, crema will suffer. However, it is important to note that crema is not a reliable indicator of quality on its own. Some excellent espresso — especially from light-roast single-origin beans — produces modest crema but tastes exceptional. Conversely, some mediocre coffee produces abundant crema that tastes thin. Use crema as one data point among many, not as the sole judge of a shot.</p>

      <h2>Problem: Shots Are Inconsistent From Day to Day</h2>
      <p>If your espresso tastes great one day and terrible the next despite using the same recipe, the likely culprit is one of several environmental or process variables you may not be controlling. First, check your dose consistency. If you are not weighing your coffee every time, variations of even one gram can shift extraction noticeably. Weigh every dose. Second, consider ambient conditions. Temperature and humidity affect both your grinder and your coffee. On humid days, coffee absorbs moisture, particles swell, and the puck becomes more resistant — your usual grind setting may produce a slower shot. On cold mornings, your machine may not have fully warmed up, reducing brew temperature. Give your machine ample warm-up time: 15 minutes for a thermoblock, 20 to 30 minutes for a single boiler, and 30 to 45 minutes for a dual boiler. Third, coffee ages. A bag of beans on day seven roast behaves differently from day fourteen. As beans degas, they become less resistant to water flow, so you may need to grind progressively finer over the life of a bag. If you track your grind setting alongside roast date, you will see this pattern emerge and learn to anticipate it rather than react to it.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sour, thin shots mean under-extraction — grind finer, raise temperature, or extend the yield.</li>
        <li>Bitter, harsh shots mean over-extraction — grind coarser, lower temperature, or shorten the yield.</li>
        <li>Channeling produces simultaneously sour and bitter flavors — fix distribution and tamp level.</li>
        <li>Lack of crema usually indicates stale beans or insufficient pressure, but crema alone is not a quality indicator.</li>
        <li>Inconsistency from day to day is often caused by not weighing doses, ambient humidity, or coffee aging.</li>
      </ul>
