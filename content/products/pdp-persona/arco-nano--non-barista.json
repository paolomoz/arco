  "description_long": "The Nano is the least intimidating real espresso machine you'll find. It weighs just 4.2 kg, takes up less space than a stack of books, and has two buttons: one for a single shot, one for a double. That's the entire interface. The thermoblock heating system means it's ready in seconds -- no waiting, no planning ahead. The PID temperature control keeps every shot consistent, so you don't need to learn any techniques to get great results. And because it uses standard ground coffee (no pods, no capsules), your per-cup cost stays low and your espresso tastes genuine. If you've been telling yourself that espresso machines are too complicated, the Nano is the machine that proves you wrong.",
