  "subheadline": "The Arco Filtro is a purpose-built filter grinder with 48mm flat burrs optimised for coarser profiles, a 30-step clicked adjustment for dead-accurate repeatability, and a compact footprint for the multi-method brewer.",

  "description_long": "If you're serious about filter coffee, you know that espresso grinders adapted for coarser settings are a compromise. The Filtro isn't adapted -- it's built from the ground up for pour-over, AeroPress, Chemex, and batch brew. The 48mm flat burrs are calibrated for the coarser end of the spectrum, producing a clean, uniform particle distribution that extracts evenly across longer brew times. The 30-step clicked adjustment means you can switch between V60 and AeroPress and return to the exact same setting every time -- no guesswork, no dial drift. At 800 RPM, the motor generates minimal heat, preserving volatile aromatics that fast grinders destroy. The 200g hopper supports a light daily workflow, and at 3.2 kg the Filtro takes up less counter space than a pour-over dripper. For the brewer who treats filter coffee with the same precision as espresso, this is the dedicated tool for the job.",

    "quote": "I was using my espresso grinder for V60 and always felt the grind was uneven at coarser settings. The Filtro is completely different -- calibrated for filter from the start. My pour-overs are cleaner, sweeter, and more transparent than anything I was getting before. It's a specialist tool and it shows.",
