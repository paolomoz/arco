            <h1>Commercial DNA. Home footprint. Full programmability.</h1>
            <p>Triple boiler system, gear pump with electronic pressure profiling, 4.3-inch touchscreen, and IoT brew logging. The Studio Pro is the closest thing to a commercial machine that fits in your kitchen.</p>

      <p>The Studio Pro exists for the barista who's exhausted every variable on lesser machines. Its triple boiler architecture dedicates separate thermal systems to brew, steam, and hot water -- zero thermal interaction, zero compromise. The gear pump delivers electronically controlled pressure profiling: design your own curves on the 4.3-inch touchscreen, save them, share them via the IoT connection. Brew pressure is adjustable from 0 to 12 bar in real time, with repeatability measured in hundredths of a bar. The saturated 58mm group head provides the thermal mass and stability of commercial equipment. Firmware updates arrive over Wi-Fi. Brew logs sync to your phone for analysis. The plumbed-in option eliminates tank management entirely. This is the machine that turns your kitchen into a research lab -- and produces shots that rival anything coming out of a specialty cafe.</p>

            <p>I've owned a Decent DE1 and a Linea Mini. The Studio Pro is better than both. The gear pump profiling is incredibly precise, the triple boiler system means I never wait, and the brew logging has genuinely improved my technique. This is the machine I'm keeping.</p>
