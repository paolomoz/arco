  "description_long": "Most grinders are designed for espresso and tolerate filter. The Arco Filtro is designed for filter and excels at it. Its 48mm flat burrs are profiled specifically for the coarser grind sizes that pour-over, AeroPress, and French press demand, producing fewer fines and more uniform particles than a typical espresso-first grinder can manage at the same settings. Twelve stepped positions are labelled by brew method — V60, Chemex, AeroPress, French press — so you can switch between methods without guesswork. The glass collection jar holds up to 40 grams and sits on a stable silicone base. If filter coffee is your daily practice, the Filtro is the grinder that respects it.",
