  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Doppio dual-boiler espresso machine in brushed steel on a dark kitchen counter, dual PID displays showing different temperatures, a perfectly textured milk pitcher beside a freshly pulled espresso with thick crema",
  "description_long": "If you've been waiting for your single boiler to cool down between brewing and steaming, you already know why the Doppio exists. Two independent brass boilers mean you pull a shot at one temperature and steam milk at another -- simultaneously, without compromise. The rotary pump is whisper-quiet and delivers pressure so consistent you'll wonder how you ever tolerated a vibratory. The E61 group head is the industry standard for a reason: thermal stability and a massive ecosystem of aftermarket accessories. This is the machine that turns frustration into satisfaction.",
  "use_case_headline": "Why upgraders choose the Doppio.",
  "use_case_body": "No more temperature surfing. No more waiting between shots and milk. No more rattling pumps. The Doppio's dual-boiler architecture, rotary pump, and E61 group head address every single pain point of a single-boiler setup -- and the difference is obvious from your very first shot.",
