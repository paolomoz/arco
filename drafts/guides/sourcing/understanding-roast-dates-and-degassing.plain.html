      <p>There is a persistent myth in specialty coffee: fresher is always better. In reality, coffee that is too fresh can taste flat, fizzy, and under-developed. Understanding how CO2 behaves after roasting — and why rest periods differ for espresso and filter — will help you time your brewing for peak flavour rather than peak freshness.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>What Happens Inside the Bean During Roasting</h2>
      <p>Roasting coffee is a controlled chemical transformation. The green bean enters the roaster at around ten percent moisture content and a temperature of roughly twenty degrees Celsius. Over the next eight to fifteen minutes (depending on the roast profile), the bean is heated to an internal temperature of between 195 and 230 degrees Celsius. During this process, hundreds of chemical reactions occur: Maillard reactions between amino acids and sugars produce browning and complex flavour compounds; caramelisation of sugars creates sweetness and body; organic acids break down and reform. One of the most significant byproducts of these reactions is carbon dioxide. As the cellular structure of the bean breaks down and new gases are formed, CO2 becomes trapped within the porous matrix of the roasted bean. A freshly roasted bean can contain roughly ten milligrams of CO2 per gram of coffee — a substantial amount given the bean's small size. This CO2 is not flavourless or inert. When you grind fresh-roasted coffee and add water, the CO2 escapes violently, causing the characteristic bloom you see during a pour-over (the grounds puff up like a mushroom as gas escapes). While visually impressive, this rapid degassing actually interferes with extraction. The escaping gas creates channels in the coffee bed, pushing water away from grounds rather than through them. It also forms a barrier on the surface of each particle, slowing the rate at which water can dissolve flavour compounds. The result is an uneven, under-extracted brew that tastes flat, sharp, and underdeveloped despite using perfectly fresh coffee.</p>

      <h2>The Degassing Curve: Why Fresh Is Not Always Best</h2>
      <p>After roasting, coffee loses CO2 rapidly at first and then more gradually over subsequent days and weeks. Roughly forty percent of the total CO2 escapes within the first twenty-four hours. Another twenty to thirty percent escapes over the next three to seven days. The remaining CO2 leaks out slowly over the following weeks. The rate of degassing depends on several factors: roast level (darker roasts degas faster because their cell structure is more disrupted), grind size (grinding accelerates degassing dramatically — pre-ground coffee degasses in hours rather than days), bean density (denser, high-altitude beans retain CO2 longer), and storage conditions (higher temperatures accelerate degassing). This degassing curve creates a window of peak flavour that does not open the moment the beans leave the roaster. For filter coffee, the window typically opens around five to seven days post-roast and extends to roughly four weeks. During this period, enough CO2 has escaped that extraction is uniform and efficient, but the aromatic volatile compounds that give coffee its complexity have not yet oxidised significantly. The bloom during a pour-over should still be visible but controlled — a gentle rise rather than an explosive puff. For espresso, the window is different and more consequential. Because espresso uses high pressure and fine grinds, CO2 has a much larger impact on the extraction. Too much CO2 creates excessive crema (which sounds appealing but actually tastes bitter and ashy), channelling through the puck, and inconsistent flow rates. Most experienced baristas find that espresso beans need ten to twenty-one days of rest after roasting to pull balanced, sweet shots reliably.</p>

      <h2>Rest Periods for Espresso vs Filter</h2>
      <p>The practical difference between espresso and filter rest periods comes down to pressure. In a pour-over, water moves through the coffee bed by gravity at essentially zero pressure. A moderate amount of residual CO2 causes a gentle bloom that actually helps distribute water evenly — it lifts and separates the grounds, creating space for water to flow. This is why five to seven days of rest is sufficient for filter: you want some CO2 for a healthy bloom, but not so much that it creates turbulence and channelling. In espresso, nine bars of pressure forces water through a dense puck of finely ground coffee in under thirty seconds. In this environment, residual CO2 creates real problems. The gas forms bubbles within the puck that disrupt the flow of water, creating channels — paths of least resistance where water rushes through without extracting the surrounding coffee. The result is a shot that is simultaneously over-extracted (in the channels) and under-extracted (in the bypassed areas). Too much CO2 also inflates the crema beyond what is desirable. Fresh crema from very new beans tastes acrid and unpleasant — it is essentially CO2 foam carrying bitter surface compounds. Well-rested crema is thinner, more stable, and sweeter. For a practical schedule: when you buy a bag of beans, note the roast date. If you plan to brew filter, you can start using it five to seven days after roast. If you plan to pull espresso, wait at least ten days, with twelve to sixteen days being the sweet spot for most medium-roasted coffees. Light roasts for espresso often benefit from even longer rest — up to twenty-one days — because their denser structure retains CO2 more stubbornly. Dark roasts can be ready for espresso as early as seven to ten days because their open, porous structure sheds gas quickly.</p>

      <h2>Storage, Staleness, and Knowing When a Coffee Is Past Its Peak</h2>
      <p>Once you understand degassing, the next question is how to store beans to extend the peak window as long as possible. The enemies of roasted coffee are oxygen, moisture, heat, and light. Oxygen causes the aromatic compounds and oils in coffee to oxidise, producing stale, cardboard-like flavours. Moisture accelerates chemical degradation. Heat speeds up every reaction. Light, particularly UV light, degrades certain compounds directly. Store your beans in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature — not in the refrigerator or freezer for daily-use coffee. The bag your beans came in is often sufficient if it has a one-way valve (the small circular vent on most specialty bags that lets CO2 escape without letting air in) and a resealable closure. If you transfer beans to a canister, choose one with a one-way valve or vacuum seal. The practical shelf life of well-stored specialty coffee is roughly four to six weeks post-roast for espresso and up to six weeks for filter. After this window, you will notice a gradual decline: the aroma becomes less complex, the cup loses brightness and sweetness, and stale or papery flavours begin to appear. The coffee is still safe to drink — it will not make you ill — but it will no longer represent what the roaster intended. The signs that a coffee has passed its peak are subtle at first: shots pull faster than they should at the same grind setting (because the beans have become more porous), pour-over bloom disappears (all CO2 has escaped), and the cup tastes flat, one-dimensional, or generically bitter. When you notice these signs, it is time for a fresh bag. Buying in quantities you can consume within three to four weeks is the simplest way to ensure every cup you brew is within its peak window.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Freshly roasted coffee contains significant CO2 that interferes with extraction — resting is essential for balanced flavour.</li>
        <li>For filter coffee, start brewing 5–7 days after roast. For espresso, wait 10–21 days depending on roast level.</li>
        <li>Darker roasts degas faster and are ready sooner; lighter roasts retain CO2 longer and benefit from extended rest.</li>
        <li>Store beans in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature. Avoid the refrigerator for daily-use coffee.</li>
        <li>Well-stored specialty coffee is at its best within 4–6 weeks of roasting. Buy in quantities you can finish in 3–4 weeks.</li>
      </ul>
