            <h1>Is the Arco Ufficio right for you?</h1>
            <p>The Ufficio is built for shared spaces where multiple people need good espresso every day without anyone becoming the designated barista. It prioritises reliability and volume over fine control. That is a deliberate choice, and it is not the right choice for everyone.</p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You manage a team of 8 to 25 people and your current office coffee situation — whether capsules, a vending machine, or a broken drip brewer — is a running joke.</li>
        <li>You need a machine that handles 30 or more cups per day without needing a maintenance call every other week.</li>
        <li>You want a heat-exchange system that lets anyone brew and steam simultaneously without understanding boiler physics.</li>
        <li>You need to justify the purchase to finance or management and want clear cost-per-cup numbers versus your current capsule spend.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Not Ideal For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are a home barista looking for a personal machine — the Ufficio's heat-exchange boiler and fixed pressure are designed for throughput, not the micro-adjustments that make home espresso satisfying.</li>
        <li>You want to experiment with pressure profiling or flow control — the Ufficio's fixed 9-bar pump is intentionally simple and does not offer those features.</li>
        <li>Your office has fewer than 5 regular coffee drinkers — the Ufficio's 2.5-litre boiler and commercial pump are oversized for light use, and a Doppio would serve you better.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div>
          <div>Will people actually use it or will they go back to capsules?</div>
          <div>This depends on setup, not on the machine. Put a clear laminated guide next to the machine, pre-set the grinder, and provide a tamper that sits on the drip tray. Offices where the Ufficio is set up for self-service see adoption rates above 80%. Offices where it is tucked in a corner with no instructions see it collect dust.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Is it cheaper than our capsule machine in the long run?</div>
          <div>Almost certainly. A typical capsule costs €0.35–0.50 per cup. The Ufficio plus beans costs approximately €0.08–0.12 per cup after amortising the machine over three years. For a 15-person office drinking 40 cups a day, that is roughly €3,000 saved per year. We have a calculator on our site that uses your actual numbers.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>What if it breaks? We can't have an office without coffee.</div>
          <div>The Ufficio uses a commercial-grade rotary pump and heat-exchange boiler — the same architecture used in cafes. It is designed for daily volume. That said, we offer a 3-year warranty and our service team can typically diagnose problems remotely. For offices that cannot tolerate any downtime, we recommend keeping a Nano as a backup.</div>
