            <h1>Great espresso. No barista skills required.</h1>
            <p>The Arco Primo was designed for people who love good coffee but have zero interest in becoming a hobbyist. It's genuinely simple -- and the espresso is genuinely excellent.</p>

      <p>Let's be honest: most espresso machines are intimidating. The Arco Primo isn't. It heats up in 90 seconds, uses a standard portafilter that's easy to load, and has exactly two buttons -- one for a single shot, one for a double. That's it. No pressure gauges to interpret, no steaming wands to master, no grind settings to agonize over. The included quick-start guide walks you through your first shot in under five minutes, and by the third morning you'll be doing it on autopilot. You don't need to become a barista to drink like one.</p>

      <h2>Coffee you'll be proud of, with nothing to learn.</h2>
      <p>The Primo ships with everything you need: portafilter, baskets, tamper, and a step-by-step quick-start guide. Pair it with pre-ground espresso coffee or the Arco Macinino grinder, and you're making cafe-quality espresso from day one.</p>

            <p>I was genuinely nervous about buying an espresso machine. I'm not a coffee person -- I just wanted better coffee than capsules. The Primo made me feel capable from the very first cup. My partner says I'm smug about it now.</p>
