            <h1>Flow profiling. Saturated group. Full control.</h1>
            <p>Dual stainless boilers, a rotary pump with integrated flow control, shot timer, and pressure gauge -- the Studio is a prosumer machine built for baristas who want to manipulate every variable.</p>

      <p>The Studio is where Arco stops holding your hand. The saturated 58mm group head delivers thermal stability measured in tenths of a degree. The rotary pump feeds through an integrated flow control valve that lets you manipulate flow rate in real time -- ramp pre-infusion, hold pressure, decline through the tail of the shot. Dual stainless steel boilers (300ml brew, 500ml steam) are independently PID-controlled, and the built-in shot timer syncs with the pump so you're never guessing. The 3-litre tank supports reservoir operation or direct plumbing for zero-interruption workflows. At 18 kg, it's substantial enough for thermal mass, compact enough for a home counter. This is the machine you buy when you've stopped asking how to make espresso and started asking what espresso can become.</p>

      <h2>For the barista who profiles, not just pulls.</h2>
      <p>Real-time flow control. Saturated group for thermal precision. Dual PID with 0.1-degree resolution. Integrated shot timer. Plumb-in capable. The Studio gives you every lever -- literally and figuratively -- to chase the shot you've been imagining.</p>

            <p>The flow control on the Studio is exceptional. I'm running declining pressure profiles on light roasts that I couldn't achieve on my previous Decent. The saturated group holds temperature like nothing I've used at home. This is a serious machine.</p>
