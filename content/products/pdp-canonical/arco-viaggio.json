The precision-machined aluminium body and stainless steel filter basket create up to 9 bars of pressure through a simple lever mechanism — your arm is the pump. Add hot water, insert your coffee, press, and in under a minute you have a real shot. The Viaggio disassembles for easy cleaning and packs into the included neoprene travel case. From mountain huts to hotel rooms to train journeys, this is espresso without boundaries.",
