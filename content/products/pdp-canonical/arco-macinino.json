  "description_long": "The Arco Macinino does one thing well: it grinds coffee beans consistently, quickly, and without fuss. The 40mm hardened steel conical burrs produce an even grind across 20 stepped settings, covering everything from espresso to French press. The built-in timer lets you set your dose once and repeat it every morning. At 10 cm wide and 18 cm tall, the Macinino occupies less counter space than a coffee mug. It is the grinder for people who understand that fresh-ground coffee tastes better and want the most direct way to get there.",
