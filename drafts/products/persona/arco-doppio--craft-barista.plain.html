            <h1>Dual brass boilers. E61 group. Rotary pump. No compromises.</h1>
            <p>The Doppio delivers independent brew and steam temperature control, a 250ml/350ml brass boiler configuration, and the thermal mass of a proper E61 -- at a price point that leaves room for a serious grinder.</p>

      <p>You know what matters in an espresso machine, so here's what the Doppio offers: dual brass boilers (250ml brew, 350ml steam) with independent PID control, a rotary pump that delivers consistent 9-bar extraction pressure, and a genuine E61 thermosyphon group head with its full thermal mass. Brew temperature is adjustable in 0.5-degree increments. The steam boiler reaches 155 degrees C for dry, powerful steam -- enough for proper microfoam in seconds. The 2.5-litre reservoir keeps you pulling back-to-back shots without refilling, and the chassis is built around serviceability: every component is accessible from the top or sides. This is a serious machine that happens to fit on a kitchen counter.</p>

      <h2>Built for the home barista who reads spec sheets.</h2>
      <p>Independent PID on both boilers. 0.5-degree brew temp adjustment. E61 group with full thermosyphon. Rotary pump. 58mm group compatibility with IMS, VST, and all commercial baskets. Back-to-back shot capability without temperature drop. Everything you need, nothing you don't.</p>

            <p>Compared the Doppio against machines costing twice as much. The brass boilers and E61 group give it thermal stability that rivals the Bianca. Rotary pump is dead silent. I paired it with the Zero and I'm pulling competition-level shots at home.</p>
