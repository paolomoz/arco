  "headline": "Personal desk espresso. No shared kitchen required.",
  "subheadline": "The Arco Nano is small enough to sit on a desk or credenza, quiet enough for an open office, and makes real espresso that puts the communal pod machine to shame.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Nano espresso machine in matte black on a clean modern office desk beside a laptop and a small plant, a shot of espresso in a double-wall glass, professional and tidy workspace, soft overhead lighting",
  "description_long": "Not every office has a kitchen. Not every kitchen has a machine worth using. The Nano solves both problems by going directly to your desk. At 4.2 kg and 18 x 28 x 25 cm, it takes up less space than a monitor stand. The thermoblock is near-silent during operation -- no one in the open plan will notice. The 1-litre tank gets you through 8 to 10 shots before needing a refill, and the drip tray is easy to empty at any sink. Per-cup cost with quality beans and a hand grinder runs about 10 to 15 cents -- a fraction of the pod machine in the break room, and incomparably better. If you're the person in the office who actually cares about coffee, the Nano is your secret weapon.",
  "use_case_headline": "Better than the break room. Quieter than a kettle.",
  "use_case_body": "The Nano's near-silent thermoblock and compact footprint make it office-appropriate without compromise. Put it on your desk, a shelf, or a filing cabinet. 8 to 10 shots per tank fill. About 10 cents per cup. No shared-machine hygiene concerns.",
