  "description_long": "If you've never owned a grinder, the Macinino is the perfect place to start. Here's what you need to know: coffee tastes dramatically better when ground fresh, and the Macinino does that for you automatically. Fill the hopper with whole beans (any beans you like), set the grind and dose once using the simple adjustment dial and timer, and then every morning you just press the button. It grinds exactly the right amount, stops on its own, and you're done. No need to weigh, no need to measure, no need to understand particle size distribution. The 64mm flat burrs are the same quality found in professional-grade grinders, but the timed dosing and set-and-forget design mean you never have to think about it. Fresh-ground coffee is the single easiest upgrade you can make -- and the Macinino makes that upgrade effortless.",
