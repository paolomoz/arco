  "comparison_intro": "The Nano is the smallest electric espresso machine we make \u2014 designed to disappear into a kitchen and still deliver a proper shot. The Primo is compact by any standard, but gives you a full-sized portafilter and a workflow closer to what you would find in a cafe. The trade-off is counter space.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Nano and Arco Primo espresso machines on a narrow kitchen counter next to a toaster and kettle, the Nano dramatically smaller, both in matte black, a tape measure subtly visible to emphasise size difference, bright morning kitchen light",

  "verdict": "The Nano is a genuinely good espresso machine that happens to be very small. It does not taste like a compromise unless you are chasing latte art or want to grow into competition baskets. The Primo costs a little more and takes a little more space, but its 58 mm portafilter and better steaming make it the stronger foundation if you think your interest in espresso might deepen over time.",
