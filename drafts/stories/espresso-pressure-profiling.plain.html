      <p>For most of espresso's history, pressure was treated as a constant. Nine bars, from start to finish, no questions asked. Pump machines were engineered to reach operating pressure as quickly as possible and hold it there until the shot was done. This approach works well and produces excellent results. But in the last decade, a growing community of baristas and equipment designers has begun asking a different question: what happens when you vary the pressure during extraction? The answer has opened up an entirely new dimension of flavor.</p>
      <p>Pressure profiling is the practice of deliberately changing the brew pressure at different stages of a shot. A common approach is the pre-infusion ramp, where the puck is wetted at low pressure, typically two to four bars, for several seconds before ramping up to full extraction pressure. This gentle saturation allows water to penetrate the coffee bed evenly, reducing the risk of channeling and promoting a more uniform extraction. The result is often a shot with increased sweetness, reduced bitterness, and a smoother mouthfeel compared to the same coffee extracted at flat nine bars.</p>
      <p>More advanced profiles go further. A declining pressure profile starts at nine bars and gradually drops to six or four bars as the shot progresses. The theory is that as the coffee bed becomes saturated and loses structural integrity, lower pressure reduces the tendency for water to find preferential paths through the puck. Some baristas use a blooming profile, where a brief pre-infusion is followed by a pause that allows CO2 to degas from freshly roasted coffee before full pressure is applied. Others experiment with oscillating or pulsing pressure, though the evidence for these approaches is largely anecdotal.</p>
      <p>To explore pressure profiling, you need a machine that gives you control. Spring lever machines offer a natural declining profile as the spring decompresses. Manual lever machines like the Arco Viaggio put you in complete control of pressure through physical effort. At the higher end, the Arco Studio features electronic pressure profiling with programmable curves that let you save and repeat profiles shot after shot. Start simple: try a five-second low-pressure pre-infusion before your normal extraction and taste the difference. Once you hear what pressure can do to a familiar coffee, you will never look at a flat nine-bar shot quite the same way.</p>
