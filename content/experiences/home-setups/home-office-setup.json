  "editorial_intro": "Your commute is fourteen steps. From the desk in the spare bedroom to the coffee station in the hallway, and back again. It is the shortest commute you have ever had, but it might be the most important, because those fourteen steps are the boundary between working and not working, between focused and fatigued, between one task and the next.",
  "editorial_body": "The coffee station lives outside the office deliberately. You tried putting the machine on your desk once, in the early days of remote work, when the novelty of working from home made every optimisation seem brilliant. Within a week, you realised the problem: the machine on the desk meant the coffee was always there, always available, always one reach away. The break disappeared. The ritual collapsed into a continuous drip feed of caffeine consumed while reading email, and the espresso became indistinguishable from the work.\n\nSo you moved it. The console table in the hallway, the one that previously held nothing but a vase and a stack of post, became the coffee station. Now making a cup requires standing up, leaving the room, and walking to a different space. It takes three minutes. Those three minutes are the most valuable part of your working day.\n\nThe Arco Doppio sits on the console table with the Preciso grinder beside it. The setup is intentionally separate from the kitchen, which is downstairs and associated with lunch, cooking, and domestic life. The hallway station is associated with one thing only: the mid-work coffee. It has its own small supply of beans, its own cups, its own rhythm.\n\nYou make your first coffee at 9:15, after the morning standup. This is the proper one, the double shot that signals the start of real, focused work. You grind, tamp, extract, and carry the cup back to the desk. By the time you sit down, the caffeine from the shot you drank at 7am over breakfast is fading, and this new one slides into the gap with perfect timing.\n\nThe second coffee comes at 11:30, between meetings. This one you drink standing at the console table, looking out the hallway window at whatever the weather is doing. It is a longer break — five minutes instead of three — and you let your mind wander. Solutions to problems you have been wrestling with tend to arrive during this coffee, as though the physical relocation from desk to hallway unlocks a different mode of thinking.\n\nThe third and final coffee is at 2:30. A single shot, shorter and sharper, the last caffeine of the day. You drink it quickly, standing, and return to the desk for the afternoon push. After 2:30, no more coffee. This is a rule you set early in the remote work transition, when the unlimited access to your own machine led to a week of five-cup days and sleepless nights.\n\nThe Doppio was chosen for its reliability across multiple daily uses. The dual boiler maintains temperature stability whether you are pulling your first shot of the day or your third. The Preciso holds its grind setting between sessions, which means the 2:30 shot is ground identically to the 9:15 one. Consistency matters when the coffee is serving a functional purpose — you need to know what each cup will deliver, and you need it to deliver the same thing every time.\n\nThe hallway station has become something you show to other remote workers. Not to brag — though you would be lying if you said the impressed reactions were not satisfying — but because the principle is genuinely useful. Separate the coffee from the desk. Make the break physical, not just temporal. Give yourself a reason to stand, walk, and do something with your hands that is not typing.\n\nThe console table cost forty pounds from a second-hand shop. The linen runner was seven. The improvement to your working day, your posture, your focus, and your coffee is beyond any sensible calculation of return on investment.\n\nWhen colleagues visit for meetings, they see the setup in the hallway and understand immediately. One of them called it your micro-cafe. Another asked if she could work from your house instead of hers. The Doppio is a serious machine producing serious espresso, and having it fourteen steps from your desk is the kind of small luxury that makes the remote work life not just tolerable but genuinely enviable.\n\nThe commute is fourteen steps. The coffee is excellent. The boundary holds.",
