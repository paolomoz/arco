            <h1>Sweeter shots. More forgiveness. Better value.</h1>
            <p>The Arco Preciso's 48mm conical burrs deliver a sweeter, rounder espresso profile that's more forgiving than flat burrs -- perfect for the barista upgrading from a blade or entry-level grinder.</p>

      <p>If you're coming from a blade grinder, a hand grinder, or a cheap burr grinder, the Preciso is the upgrade that bridges the gap between frustration and satisfaction. Its 48mm steel conical burrs produce a grind profile that naturally emphasises sweetness and body -- more forgiving than flat burrs, which means you'll get good results even when your dose or tamp isn't perfect. The 40-step macro adjustment with micro-fine tuning gives you precision when you want it, without the overwhelming stepless dial of a professional grinder. Retention is under 0.8 grams -- dramatically better than most grinders in this class. And at its price point, the Preciso leaves budget for the beans and accessories that complete the upgrade. Your shots will be noticeably sweeter, more consistent, and more forgiving. That's the upgrade that actually matters.</p>

      <h2>The upgrade that forgives while it improves.</h2>
      <p>Conical burrs are more forgiving than flat -- you get a sweeter, rounder shot even when variables aren't perfect. The 40-step adjustment is intuitive and repeatable. Under 0.8g retention means consistency. If you're stepping up from an entry-level grinder, the Preciso is the sweet spot of quality and value.</p>

            <p>I upgraded from a Hario hand grinder and the Preciso was an absolute revelation. My shots went from inconsistent and bitter to sweet and balanced overnight. The conical burrs are so much more forgiving -- I actually enjoy dialing in now instead of dreading it.</p>
