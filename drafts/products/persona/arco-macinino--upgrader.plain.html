      <p>Your grinder matters more than your machine. If you're still using a stepped grinder, a blade grinder, or the built-in grinder from an automatic, the Macinino will transform your espresso overnight. Its 64mm Italian flat burrs produce a unimodal particle distribution that extracts more evenly and tastes cleaner than anything a conical or smaller flat burr can achieve. The stepless micrometric adjustment lets you dial in with a precision that stepped grinders simply can't match -- fine-tune your grind in micro-increments until your shot is exactly where you want it. Retention is under 0.5 grams, which means less waste and more consistency between doses. The 1400 RPM motor grinds a full dose in about 5 seconds, and the timed dosing feature makes it repeatable every time. If you've been blaming your machine for underwhelming shots, the Macinino might be the upgrade that actually solves the problem.</p>

      <h2>The single upgrade that makes the biggest difference.</h2>
      <p>64mm flat burrs vs. your current conical or stepped grinder: more uniform particle size, more even extraction, more flavour clarity. Stepless adjustment for micro-fine dialing. Under 0.5g retention. The Macinino is the grinder upgrade that makes your existing machine perform like a different machine entirely.</p>

            <p>I was spending all my energy trying to get better shots from my machine. Then I replaced my Baratza with the Macinino and everything changed. Same machine, same beans, completely different espresso. The flat burrs and stepless adjustment are a revelation.</p>
