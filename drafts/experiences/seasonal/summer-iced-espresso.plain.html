            <h1>When the heat arrives, the coffee adapts.</h1>
            <p>Cold brew, iced espresso, espresso tonic — summer has its own coffee vocabulary.</p>

      <p>June arrives and the hot espresso that anchored your mornings for nine months starts to feel wrong. The kitchen is warm, the cup warms your hands when your hands do not need warming, and the first sip sits heavy in the heat. Summer demands a different approach. The coffee does not get worse. It gets colder.</p>

      <p>The transition happens every year at roughly the same point — the first morning when you walk to the machine and think, not today. Not hot. Something in you shifts with the temperature, and the dense, warming ritual of a hot double shot gives way to a craving for something cold, bright, and refreshing.

Cold brew is where most people start, and it is where the Arco Filtro earns its summer keep. The principle is simple: coarsely ground coffee steeped in cold water for twelve to eighteen hours, then filtered. The result is a concentrate — smooth, low in acidity, with a natural sweetness that hot brewing does not produce. You make it in the Filtro's carafe, filling the basket with fifty grams of coarsely ground coffee, adding cold filtered water, and leaving it in the fridge overnight.

The morning routine in summer starts with the fridge rather than the machine. You pour the cold brew concentrate over ice, dilute it with cold water or milk, and carry the glass to the table. The first sip is a shock — cold, clean, sweet. The coffee flavours are there but softened by the cold extraction into something gentle and endlessly drinkable. The Ethiopian that was bright and acidic as espresso becomes floral and honeyed as cold brew. The Colombian that was rich and chocolatey becomes smooth and nutty.

But cold brew is only one chapter of the summer coffee book. The espresso tonic became your signature serve last July, when you tried it at a specialty cafe and realised you could make it better at home. A double shot of espresso, pulled normally, poured over ice and topped with premium tonic water. The bitterness of the coffee meets the quinine of the tonic, and the combination is electric — bitter, sweet, effervescent, and deeply refreshing. A slice of lemon or a sprig of rosemary takes it further. Guests who try it for the first time tend to say nothing for a moment, processing the unfamiliar combination, and then ask for another.

Iced lattes are the everyday option. Espresso pulled directly over ice — the thermal shock locks in the flavour and produces a concentrate that stands up to milk — then topped with cold milk. Simple, fast, and satisfying in a way that hot coffee cannot match when the thermometer passes twenty-five degrees.

The Filtro handles the cold brew production with minimal effort. Its calibrated basket and insulated carafe make dosing and filtering consistent, and the carafe keeps the concentrate cold in the fridge without absorbing odours. You make a batch every three days, which produces enough for two glasses per day with some left over for whoever drops by.

The beans change in summer too. You gravitate toward lighter roasts — washed Ethiopians, Kenyan single origins, anything with fruit and floral notes that come alive in cold preparations. The dark blends that anchored your winter espressos feel too heavy, too roasted, for iced drinks. The cold extraction favours brightness, and the beans you choose should match.

Your summer setup is simpler than your winter one. The espresso machine still runs for the occasional iced shot or espresso tonic, but the Filtro does the heavy lifting. The grinder adjusts from fine to coarse, the fridge stores the concentrate, and the ice tray — filled nightly, a new habit that runs from June to September — ensures you are never caught without.

There is a particular pleasure in summer coffee that winter coffee does not offer. The glass sweating on the table. The clink of ice as you drink. The brightness of the liquid in the light. Coffee becomes visual in summer — you see it differently when it is in a clear glass instead of an opaque cup, and the layers of espresso and milk and ice create something genuinely beautiful.

Friends drop by more in summer. The garden is open, the doors are wide, and the offer of an iced coffee or an espresso tonic is enough to extend a casual visit into an afternoon. You have become the person who makes cold coffee in summer, and the reputation is surprisingly valuable — it is an invitation that people accept without hesitation.

You keep a small collection of glassware specifically for summer drinks. Tall Collins glasses for iced lattes, short rocks glasses for iced espressos, and a set of elegant highballs for the espresso tonics. The presentation matters more in summer because the drink is visible. A cold brew in a clear glass, served on a tray with a sprig of mint, looks like something from a magazine. The effort is minimal. The impression is disproportionate.

The afternoon ritual changes too. Where winter afternoons call for a short, hot espresso at the desk, summer afternoons want something long and cold, sipped slowly while sitting outside. You bring the glass to the garden or the balcony and let the afternoon unfold around you. The ice melts gradually, diluting the drink over thirty minutes, and the last sip is lighter, weaker, but still recognisably coffee. The slow dilution is a feature, not a flaw — it matches the pace of a summer afternoon.

By September, the mornings cool and the craving for hot espresso returns. The Filtro goes back to its primary role. The ice trays are emptied. The dark roasts come out of the cupboard. The seasonal shift is complete, and the cycle will repeat next year.

Summer coffee is not a compromise. It is a different language for the same thing — the daily pleasure of something made well, adapted to the conditions, served at the temperature the season demands.</p>
