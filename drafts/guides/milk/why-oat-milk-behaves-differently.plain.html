      <p>Oat milk has become the default dairy alternative in specialty coffee for good reason — it steams better, tastes more neutral, and integrates with espresso more naturally than any other plant milk. But it is not dairy, and it does not behave like dairy. Understanding the chemistry behind oat milk's quirks will help you steam it well rather than fight it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>The Chemistry: Why Oat Milk Is Not Just Thin Dairy</h2>
      <p>Dairy milk is an emulsion of fat globules and casein protein micelles suspended in a water-based solution of whey protein, lactose, and minerals. This complex system has evolved over millions of years to be nutritionally complete and structurally stable. When you steam dairy, you are working with a natural material whose proteins, fats, and sugars interact with heat and air in predictable, well-understood ways. Oat milk is an engineered product with a fundamentally different composition. It is made by soaking oats in water, blending them, straining out the solids, and then adding emulsifiers (often rapeseed or sunflower oil), stabilisers (like gellan gum or dipotassium phosphate), and sometimes enzymes that break down the oat starch into simpler sugars for sweetness. The protein content is typically lower than dairy — around one percent compared to dairy's 3.3 percent — and the proteins are plant-derived (avenin and globulin), which behave differently from whey and casein under heat. The fat in oat milk is added vegetable oil, not naturally emulsified milk fat, and the sugars are a mix of maltose and glucose produced by enzymatic starch breakdown rather than lactose. This means that every aspect of the foaming process — bubble formation, bubble stabilisation, mouthfeel, sweetness development, and heat tolerance — follows different rules in oat milk than in dairy. The protein films that stabilise bubbles are weaker and less elastic. The fat behaves differently under heat because it is vegetable oil rather than butterfat. And the sugar profile changes the sweetness curve as temperature rises. None of this makes oat milk worse for coffee — it just makes it different, and that difference requires an adjusted approach.</p>

      <h2>Which Oat Milks Steam Well — and Why</h2>
      <p>Not all oat milks are created equal when it comes to steaming. The difference between a barista-grade oat milk and a standard supermarket oat milk is dramatic, and it comes down to formulation choices that affect foaming, stability, and heat tolerance. Barista-edition oat milks (such as Oatly Barista Edition, Minor Figures, and Califia Barista Blend) are specifically formulated for coffee. They typically contain higher fat content (around three percent versus one to two percent in standard versions), added emulsifiers like dipotassium phosphate that help stabilise foam, and sometimes acidity regulators that prevent curdling when the oat milk meets the acidic environment of espresso. The higher fat and better emulsification produce a creamier mouthfeel and more stable foam. Standard oat milks lack these modifications. Their lower fat content produces a thinner, less satisfying mouthfeel. Their protein structure is less capable of stabilising bubbles, so foam forms unevenly and breaks down quickly. And without acidity regulators, they are prone to splitting or curdling when poured into hot espresso — the acid in the coffee denatures the plant proteins and breaks the emulsion, producing an unappetising grainy texture. When choosing an oat milk for espresso-based drinks, always look for the 'barista' or 'professional' designation. The price premium of roughly thirty to fifty percent over standard oat milk is justified by a vastly superior steaming experience. Within the barista category, different brands have slightly different textures and flavour profiles. Oatly Barista is the most widely used in specialty shops and has a slightly sweet, oaty flavour. Minor Figures is less sweet with a more neutral taste. Experimenting with two or three brands will help you find one that suits your palate and your espresso.</p>

      <h2>Steaming Technique Adjustments for Oat Milk</h2>
      <p>The fundamental mechanics of steaming oat milk are the same as dairy — stretch, then texture — but the timing, temperature, and technique need adjustment because of the differences in protein and fat behaviour. Temperature is the most important adjustment. Oat milk's plant proteins are less heat-stable than dairy's whey proteins, which means the foam structure breaks down at a lower temperature. Aim for fifty-five to sixty degrees Celsius — roughly five degrees lower than dairy. Above sixty degrees, oat milk foam becomes thin and watery as the protein films fail, and the drink develops a slightly starchy, cooked-cereal flavour that is unpleasant. The hand-on-pitcher method works here too: stop when the pitcher feels hot but not painfully so — a notch below your dairy stopping point. Stretching time should be slightly shorter than with dairy. Because oat milk's proteins form weaker bubble walls, introducing too much air creates bubbles that cannot be textured into stable microfoam. One to two seconds of stretching — just enough for a brief chirp from the steam wand — is usually sufficient for a flat white. If you stretch for the same duration as dairy, you will likely end up with a layer of loose, large-bubbled foam that separates from the liquid within seconds. Texturing is where extra care pays off. The vortex phase needs to be thorough and continuous to break the fragile oat milk bubbles into the smallest possible size. Keep the wand tip angled to maintain a strong, visible whirlpool throughout the texturing phase. The vortex is doing more work than it does with dairy because the bubbles are starting from a weaker position. After steaming, pour immediately. Oat milk microfoam is less stable than dairy microfoam and begins to separate noticeably within twenty to thirty seconds. Swirl the pitcher vigorously, give one firm tap on the counter, and pour. If you are making multiple drinks, steam each jug individually rather than steaming a large batch — by the time you pour the second drink from a shared jug, the foam will have degraded.</p>

      <h2>Troubleshooting Common Oat Milk Problems</h2>
      <p>Even with adjusted technique, oat milk presents some specific problems that dairy does not. Knowing how to address each one will save you frustration and wasted milk. Curdling or splitting — the oat milk separates into grainy clumps when it hits the espresso — is the most common complaint. This is caused by the acid in the espresso denaturing the plant proteins and breaking the emulsion. Three factors prevent it: use a barista-edition oat milk with acidity regulators, pour the espresso into the milk rather than the milk into the espresso (this reduces the initial acid shock), and avoid overheating the milk (higher temperatures make proteins more vulnerable to acid denaturation). If you are using a good barista oat milk and still experiencing splitting, your espresso may be unusually acidic. Try a slightly darker roast or a different blend. Thin, watery foam that disappears quickly indicates either too much stretching (large bubbles that pop rapidly), too high a steaming temperature (protein films have failed), or a standard oat milk that lacks the emulsifiers needed for stable foam. Switch to a barista-edition product and reduce both stretching time and target temperature. A starchy or cereal-like taste means the oat milk was overheated. The starch compounds in oat milk undergo further breakdown at high temperatures, producing a cooked-porridge flavour. Keeping below sixty degrees eliminates this issue. Some brands taste more starchy than others at any temperature — if you notice this consistently, try a different brand. An overly sweet taste (sometimes described as cloying) comes from the enzymatic sugar conversion during manufacturing. Some barista oat milks are quite sweet by design. If this bothers you, look for brands marketed as 'unsweetened' barista editions, or try a brand like Minor Figures that has a more neutral sugar profile. The sweetness also intensifies when the milk is overheated, so temperature control helps here as well.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Oat milk's plant proteins, added vegetable fats, and starch-derived sugars behave differently from dairy under heat — adjust your technique accordingly.</li>
        <li>Always use a barista-edition oat milk. Standard oat milks lack the emulsifiers and fat needed for stable foam and will curdle in acidic espresso.</li>
        <li>Steam to 55–60 C, about 5 degrees lower than dairy. Above 60 C, oat milk foam breaks down and develops a starchy flavour.</li>
        <li>Stretch briefly (1–2 seconds) and texture thoroughly. Oat milk bubbles are fragile and need more spinning to reach stable microfoam.</li>
        <li>Pour immediately after steaming. Oat milk microfoam separates faster than dairy — you have about 20–30 seconds before quality drops.</li>
      </ul>
