            <h1>Is the Arco Macinino right for you?</h1>
            <p>The Macinino is our most affordable grinder and the one we recommend most often as a first grinder. It does the fundamentals well and reliably. But affordable grinders have limits, and you should know what those limits are before you buy.</p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are buying your first grinder for espresso and want something reliable that pairs naturally with the Primo or Nano without overthinking the setup.</li>
        <li>You grind the same beans most of the time and don't frequently switch between wildly different coffees or brewing methods.</li>
        <li>You want stepped settings that are repeatable and intuitive — set it to 8, and it grinds at 8 every time without drift.</li>
        <li>You have a budget of around €130 for a grinder and want the best quality available at that price without compromising on espresso capability.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Not Ideal For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You change beans frequently and need to micro-adjust grind size between bags — the stepped settings can leave you stuck between two positions where neither is quite right.</li>
        <li>You are pairing it with a Doppio, Studio, or better — at that machine price point, the Macinino becomes the weakest link in your chain, and you will taste the limitation.</li>
        <li>You want to single-dose with minimal retention — the Macinino retains approximately 1–2 grams between doses, which is acceptable for a daily routine but not for switching beans shot to shot.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div>
          <div>Do I really need a dedicated grinder, or can I buy pre-ground coffee?</div>
          <div>Pre-ground coffee is espresso's biggest compromise. Coffee begins losing flavour within minutes of grinding. A Macinino grinding fresh beans will produce noticeably better espresso than any pre-ground bag, even through the same machine. If you are investing in an espresso machine, a grinder is not optional — it is the other half of the equation.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Should I save up for the Preciso instead?</div>
          <div>If you are pairing with a Primo or Nano, the Macinino is the right match — you won't taste the Preciso's advantages through those machines. If you are pairing with a Doppio or better, yes, save for the Preciso. The grinder-machine pairing matters more than either component on its own.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Why doesn't Arco make a cheaper grinder?</div>
          <div>Because below a certain quality threshold, a grinder does more harm than good. A bad grinder produces inconsistent particle sizes that cause channeling and uneven extraction, making even good beans taste flat. The Macinino is our minimum — below this, the espresso suffers regardless of the machine.</div>
