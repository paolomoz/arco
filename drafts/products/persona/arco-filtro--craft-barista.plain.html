            <h1>48mm flats calibrated for filter. Stepped for repeatability.</h1>
            <p>The Arco Filtro is a purpose-built filter grinder with 48mm flat burrs optimised for coarser profiles, a 30-step clicked adjustment for dead-accurate repeatability, and a compact footprint for the multi-method brewer.</p>

      <p>If you're serious about filter coffee, you know that espresso grinders adapted for coarser settings are a compromise. The Filtro isn't adapted -- it's built from the ground up for pour-over, AeroPress, Chemex, and batch brew. The 48mm flat burrs are calibrated for the coarser end of the spectrum, producing a clean, uniform particle distribution that extracts evenly across longer brew times. The 30-step clicked adjustment means you can switch between V60 and AeroPress and return to the exact same setting every time -- no guesswork, no dial drift. At 800 RPM, the motor generates minimal heat, preserving volatile aromatics that fast grinders destroy. The 200g hopper supports a light daily workflow, and at 3.2 kg the Filtro takes up less counter space than a pour-over dripper. For the brewer who treats filter coffee with the same precision as espresso, this is the dedicated tool for the job.</p>

      <h2>Purpose-built for the precision filter brewer.</h2>
      <p>Filter-optimised 48mm flat burrs. 30-step clicked adjustment for exact repeatability. 800 RPM for low heat. Purpose-calibrated for V60, AeroPress, Chemex, batch brew, and French press. This is not an espresso grinder with a wider range -- it's a filter grinder, period.</p>

            <p>I was using my espresso grinder for V60 and always felt the grind was uneven at coarser settings. The Filtro is completely different -- calibrated for filter from the start. My pour-overs are cleaner, sweeter, and more transparent than anything I was getting before. It's a specialist tool and it shows.</p>
