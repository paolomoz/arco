  "description_long": "The Arco Doppio removes the biggest limitation of single-boiler machines: waiting. With independent boilers for brewing and steaming, you can pull a shot and texture milk simultaneously — a workflow that changes how your mornings feel. PID temperature control on both boilers keeps extraction stable within ±1°C, so your espresso tastes the same on the hundredth shot as the first. The 58mm commercial portafilter, quick-set steam wand, and clean digital interface make the Doppio a machine you'll use for years without outgrowing.",
