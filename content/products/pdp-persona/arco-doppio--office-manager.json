  "description_long": "For a small office or studio, the Doppio hits a sweet spot that commercial machines and pod systems both miss. Its dual-boiler architecture means someone can pull a shot while another steams milk -- no waiting, no queuing. The rotary pump handles back-to-back extractions without pressure drops, and the 2.5-litre tank gets a small team through the morning without constant refilling. Unlike pod machines, the Doppio uses standard ground coffee or fresh beans, which means dramatically lower per-cup costs and dramatically better coffee. Unlike full commercial equipment, it fits on a standard countertop, runs on a standard outlet, and costs a fraction to maintain. For teams of 5 to 10 who care about quality, this is the most cost-effective way to keep everyone caffeinated and happy.",
  "use_case_headline": "Better coffee. Lower cost per cup. Happier team.",
  "use_case_body": "At roughly 15 to 20 cents per espresso (using quality beans), the Doppio pays for itself within months compared to pod systems or daily cafe runs. The dual-boiler design handles the morning rush without bottlenecks, and the E61 group head is built for thousands of cycles.",
