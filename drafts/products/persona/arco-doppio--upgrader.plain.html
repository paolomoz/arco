            <h1>The dual boiler that ends the compromise.</h1>
            <p>Independent brew and steam boilers, a rotary pump, and an E61 group head. The Doppio is where single-boiler frustrations go to die.</p>

      <p>If you've been waiting for your single boiler to cool down between brewing and steaming, you already know why the Doppio exists. Two independent brass boilers mean you pull a shot at one temperature and steam milk at another -- simultaneously, without compromise. The rotary pump is whisper-quiet and delivers pressure so consistent you'll wonder how you ever tolerated a vibratory. The E61 group head is the industry standard for a reason: thermal stability and a massive ecosystem of aftermarket accessories. This is the machine that turns frustration into satisfaction.</p>

      <h2>Why upgraders choose the Doppio.</h2>
      <p>No more temperature surfing. No more waiting between shots and milk. No more rattling pumps. The Doppio's dual-boiler architecture, rotary pump, and E61 group head address every single pain point of a single-boiler setup -- and the difference is obvious from your very first shot.</p>

            <p>I upgraded from a Breville Bambino and the Doppio is a completely different experience. Simultaneous brew and steam changed my mornings. The rotary pump alone was worth the price of admission -- dead silent, rock steady.</p>
