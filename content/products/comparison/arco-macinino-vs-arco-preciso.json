The Preciso is a stepless grinder with near-zero retention that gives you control most people don't realise they're missing. The gap between these two grinders is often bigger than the gap between the machines they feed.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Macinino and Arco Preciso grinders side by side on a white marble countertop, the Macinino compact and minimal, the Preciso taller with its visible stepless adjustment collar, a small pile of freshly ground coffee in a dosing cup between them, clean studio lighting",

  "verdict": "The Macinino is an honest grinder that punches above its price and pairs perfectly with the Primo for simple morning workflows. But if you are pulling shots on a Doppio or better and wonder why some days taste different from others, the grinder is almost always the answer. The Preciso's stepless adjustment and low retention make it the single most impactful upgrade many home baristas can make.",
