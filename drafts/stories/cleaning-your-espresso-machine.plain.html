      <p>A freshly cleaned espresso machine does not just look better. It tastes better. Coffee oils are volatile compounds that begin to oxidize and turn rancid within hours of contact with metal surfaces. Left unchecked, these residues build up inside your group head, shower screen, portafilter basket, and steam wand, imparting bitter, acrid off-flavors to every shot you pull. Regular cleaning is not optional maintenance. It is the single most important thing you can do to protect the flavor of your coffee and the longevity of your machine.</p>
      <p>Daily cleaning should be simple and fast. After your last shot of the day, remove the portafilter and wipe the gasket and shower screen with a damp cloth. Run a blank shot of water through the group to flush loose grounds. If your machine supports backflushing, do a water-only backflush by inserting a blind basket, running the pump for ten seconds, and releasing. This cycles water backward through the solenoid valve and three-way exhaust, clearing oil deposits before they harden. Wipe down the steam wand immediately after every use. Milk residue bakes onto the tip within minutes and becomes extremely difficult to remove once dried.</p>
      <p>Weekly, perform a chemical backflush using a dedicated espresso machine cleaner. Cafiza, Puly Caff, and similar products are specifically formulated to dissolve coffee oils without damaging seals or metal components. Add a small amount to your blind basket, backflush five to six times, then follow with several plain water flushes to remove all traces of detergent. Soak your portafilter basket and shower screen in a hot solution of the same cleaner for 15 to 20 minutes, then scrub with a soft brush and rinse thoroughly. You will be surprised by how much brown residue comes off parts that looked clean.</p>
      <p>Descaling addresses a different problem: mineral buildup from your water supply. Scale accumulates inside boilers, heat exchangers, and internal tubing, reducing heat transfer efficiency and eventually restricting flow. Most manufacturers recommend descaling every two to three months, though the frequency depends on your water hardness. Use a descaling product recommended by your machine's manufacturer and follow their specific procedure, as the process varies between single-boiler, dual-boiler, and heat-exchanger designs. If you use properly treated or filtered water, you may be able to extend the interval, but do not skip descaling entirely. Prevention is always cheaper than repair.</p>
