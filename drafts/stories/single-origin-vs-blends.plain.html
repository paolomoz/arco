      <p>The specialty coffee movement has elevated single origin coffees to near-mythic status. Bags arrive with tasting notes that read like wine labels: bergamot, stone fruit, brown butter, jasmine. Meanwhile, blends, the workhorses of espresso for over a century, are sometimes dismissed as a compromise. The truth, as usual, is more nuanced. Both single origins and blends have a place on your espresso bar, and the best choice depends on what you are after in the cup.</p>
      <p>Single origin espresso showcases the unique character of a specific farm, region, or lot. A washed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe might deliver floral aromatics and a bright citrus acidity. A natural-process Brazilian from Cerrado could offer chocolate, hazelnut, and a heavy, syrupy body. The appeal is transparency: you taste the terroir, the processing, the roaster's intent. But single origins can be unforgiving in espresso. Their narrow flavor profile means that small shifts in extraction, just a gram off on dose or a few seconds long on time, can push the shot from delightful to unbalanced. They also change with the seasons, which means your favorite lot may not be available year-round.</p>
      <p>Blends are designed to solve these problems. A skilled roaster combines beans from two or more origins to create a flavor profile that is balanced, complex, and reproducible. A base of Brazilian naturals might provide body and sweetness, while a washed Colombian adds brightness and a Guatemalan contributes chocolate depth. The individual components are chosen so that their strengths complement each other and their weaknesses cancel out. The result is a shot that is more forgiving of small extraction errors and more consistent across seasons, because the roaster can swap in substitute lots when a particular origin is unavailable.</p>
      <p>Our recommendation for home baristas is to keep both in rotation. Use a reliable blend as your daily driver, the coffee you reach for on autopilot at 6 a.m. when dialing in is the last thing you want to do. Then treat single origins as your weekend exploration, the coffees you pull when you have time to experiment, adjust, and taste with full attention. Pair lighter single origins with flat-burr grinders for maximum clarity, and lean on conical burrs for blends where body and sweetness are the priority. Either way, buy fresh, store properly, and let your palate be the guide.</p>
