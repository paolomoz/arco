      <p>The Doppio is a genuinely capable dual-boiler machine that will satisfy most home baristas for years. The Studio adds saturated group head design, pre-infusion control, and build quality that crosses into semi-professional territory. The question is whether you will use those features or just admire them.</p>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>The Doppio is an outstanding machine for its price and will genuinely satisfy most home baristas. The Studio is for people who have already developed their technique and want equipment that can keep up with their curiosity. If you are still learning to dial in, the Doppio gives you plenty of runway. If you already know what pre-infusion does and want to control it, the Studio is where your money goes further.</p>
