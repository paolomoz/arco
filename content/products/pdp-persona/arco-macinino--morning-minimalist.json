  "description_long": "Grinding fresh makes the single biggest difference in coffee quality, but most grinders ask you to weigh, adjust, and fuss every time. The Macinino doesn't. Set your grind size once (it holds the setting indefinitely), programme your dose using the timed dosing feature, and then every morning is the same: put the portafilter under the spout, press the button, done. The 64mm Italian flat burrs grind quickly and evenly, the low-retention design means almost nothing stays behind in the chamber, and the timed dosing delivers a consistent dose within half a gram. Fill the hopper once a week with your favourite beans and forget about it. Your morning just got noticeably better with exactly one new step.",

  "use_case_body": "Fill the hopper. Set the timer once. Every morning after that, just press the button. The Macinino's timed dosing and low retention mean your dose is consistent without scales or measuring. Fresh-ground coffee with zero added complexity.",
