      <p>Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. At 2,000 meters, it boils at 93 degrees. At 3,500 meters, it boils at 87 degrees. If you are brewing espresso at altitude — in a mountain cabin, on a ski trip, or while trekking — these numbers change everything about your extraction. Here is the physics and the practical workaround.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Why Altitude Affects Brewing</h2>
      <p>The boiling point of water decreases as atmospheric pressure drops, and atmospheric pressure drops as altitude increases. At sea level, standard atmospheric pressure is 1,013 millibars, and water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. For every 300 meters of elevation gain, the boiling point drops by approximately one degree. At 1,500 meters — the altitude of many Alpine resort towns — water boils at about 95 degrees. At 3,000 meters — high mountain refuges, some Andean cities — it boils at roughly 90 degrees. For drip coffee and pour-over, this is primarily a temperature problem. Lower boiling points mean your water is cooler than expected, which reduces extraction. The fix is straightforward: grind finer to compensate for the lower temperature, extending contact time and surface area to maintain extraction yield. For espresso, the problem is more complex. Espresso machines create their own pressure environment — the pump generates nine bars of pressure inside the group head, which is many times higher than atmospheric pressure. This means the water inside the sealed brewing chamber can be heated above its atmospheric boiling point without actually boiling. A pump machine at 2,000 meters can still deliver water at 93 degrees to the puck, even though water boils at 93 degrees in an open container at that altitude. The machine's sealed system effectively overrides the altitude constraint during extraction. But the problem shifts to the boiler or thermoblock, where water is initially heated.</p>

      <h2>How Different Machine Types Respond</h2>
      <p>In a boiler-based espresso machine, water is heated in a sealed, pressurized vessel. The boiler pressure at operating temperature is typically between 1 and 1.5 bars, which raises the effective boiling point well above the atmospheric level. At 2,000 meters, a sealed boiler still heats water to its programmed temperature — say, 94 degrees — without difficulty, because the internal pressure prevents boiling at that temperature. These machines are largely altitude-proof, and most home baristas traveling with a machine like the Arco Studio will notice no difference in shot quality up to about 3,000 meters. Thermoblock machines are more susceptible. A thermoblock heats water as it flows through a narrow channel, and the system is not sealed in the same way as a boiler. At altitude, water passing through the thermoblock may reach its atmospheric boiling point and flash to steam inside the channel before it reaches the puck. This creates air pockets in the water stream, disrupting flow and causing temperature instability. You may notice sputtering from the group head and shots that taste thin and under-extracted. Some thermoblock machines have enough internal pressure in the water circuit to prevent this, but others do not. If you are taking an Arco Primo or Nano to altitude, test at the destination — if shots are sputtering, the thermoblock is boiling prematurely, and you will need to adjust. Manual lever devices like the Arco Viaggio sidestep the issue entirely because the water is heated externally and loaded into the chamber already at the desired temperature.</p>

      <h2>Practical Adjustments for Altitude Brewing</h2>
      <p>If your machine functions normally at altitude — no sputtering, no steam pockets — you may still need to adjust your recipe. The lower ambient air pressure slightly changes how the coffee puck behaves during extraction. At altitude, the pressure differential between the pump's nine bars and the atmospheric back-pressure is slightly larger than at sea level, which can marginally increase flow rate. The effect is small — perhaps one or two seconds difference on a thirty-second shot — but it can tip a well-dialed shot slightly toward under-extraction. To compensate, grind one click finer than your sea-level setting. This increases puck resistance and brings flow rate back to your target range. For kettle-based brewing — including the Arco Viaggio and manual lever devices — the temperature problem is real. If water boils at 93 degrees at your altitude, you cannot heat it above that without a pressure vessel. For espresso, 93 degrees is actually within the standard brewing range, so this may work well with medium and dark roasts. For light roasts that benefit from higher temperatures (95 to 96 degrees), you are at a disadvantage. Grinding finer helps compensate by increasing extraction through surface area rather than temperature. You can also insulate your brewing setup — preheating the Viaggio's chamber with hot water before loading the dose, wrapping the kettle to maintain temperature — to minimize heat loss during the brief window between boiling and brewing.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Altitude Brewing: Field Notes</h2>
      <p>We tested the Arco Viaggio at three elevations during a field trip in the Swiss Alps: 500 meters (Bern), 1,800 meters (Wengen), and 3,450 meters (Jungfraujoch). At 500 meters, the Viaggio performed identically to sea-level testing — water boiled at 98.3 degrees, shots pulled in the expected range, and flavor matched our lab baseline. At 1,800 meters, water boiled at 94.1 degrees. Shots using our standard recipe were slightly thinner and more acidic than the baseline, consistent with mild under-extraction from lower water temperature. Grinding two clicks finer restored the balance — the increased surface area compensated for the reduced thermal energy. Shots were perhaps three percent different from the baseline in a blind cupping, which is within the range of acceptable variation. At 3,450 meters, water boiled at 86.8 degrees. This is below the viable espresso extraction range for any roast level. Shots were sharply sour and thin, with almost no body. Grinding finer helped slightly, but the fundamental temperature deficit was too large to overcome through grind adjustment alone. At this extreme altitude, we achieved acceptable results only with a dark-roasted bean — the increased solubility of heavily developed roasts partially compensated for the low water temperature — and by using a double dose (20 grams) to extend contact time. It was drinkable espresso, but it was not good espresso. The honest conclusion: portable lever espresso is excellent up to about 2,500 meters with recipe adjustments. Beyond that, you are fighting physics, and filter coffee brewed at a longer steep time becomes a more practical option.</p>

        <li>Grind finer at altitude to compensate for lower water temperature and slightly increased flow rate through the puck.</li>
        <li>Manual lever brewing is viable up to about 2,500 meters with adjustments; beyond that, filter coffee is more practical.</li>
