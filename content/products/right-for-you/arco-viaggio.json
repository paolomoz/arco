  "headline": "Is the Arco Viaggio right for you?",
  "intro": "The Viaggio is a hand-powered espresso maker that weighs 340 grams and needs no electricity. It makes real espresso in places no electric machine can reach. But it asks more of you than any other product we sell, and honest expectations matter.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Viaggio manual espresso maker on a weathered wooden table at a campsite, a thermos of hot water beside it, mountains visible in the background, morning mist, the Viaggio's compact size emphasised by the expansive landscape around it",
  "perfect_for": [
    "You travel frequently for work or leisure and refuse to accept hotel room coffee or airport espresso as your only options.",
    "You camp, hike, or spend time in places without reliable electricity and still want genuine espresso, not instant coffee.",
    "You are an experienced barista who appreciates the stripped-down physics of hand-pressure espresso and finds the process meditative rather than frustrating.",
    "You want something that fits in a jacket pocket, a backpack side pouch, or a carry-on toiletry bag without taking up meaningful space."
  ],
  "not_ideal_for": [
    "You have never made espresso before \u2014 the Viaggio requires you to generate consistent pressure by hand, heat water separately, and grind your beans with a hand grinder. The learning curve is steeper than any of our electric machines.",
    "You want milk drinks \u2014 there is no steam system of any kind. The Viaggio makes straight espresso and nothing else.",
    "You want a daily home machine \u2014 the Viaggio is capable of making a daily espresso, but the manual effort of heating water, hand-grinding, and pressing makes it a poor substitute for an electric machine when you have access to a power outlet."
  ],
  "what_you_need_to_know": [
    "Pressure is generated by hand, and that means it varies. Experienced users consistently reach 7\u20139 bar, but it takes practice. Your first few shots will likely be under-extracted. This is normal. The included pressure indicator helps you calibrate your force.",
    "You need pre-heated water at approximately 93\u00b0C. A travel kettle, a thermos, or even boiled water left to cool for 30 seconds will work. The Viaggio does not heat water \u2014 it only generates pressure.",
    "You need a grinder. Most Viaggio owners pair it with a quality hand grinder for travel. The Viaggio is relatively forgiving of grind inconsistency compared to pump machines, but a medium-fine espresso grind still produces the best results."
  ],
  "common_objections": [
    {
      "objection": "Does it really make espresso, or is it just strong coffee?",
      "honest_answer": "It makes genuine espresso with crema. The physics are the same as a pump machine \u2014 water under 7\u20139 bar of pressure forced through finely ground coffee. The difference is that you are the pump. With practice, the output is remarkably close to a good electric machine. Without practice, it is strong coffee. The learning curve is about a week of daily use."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Is \u20ac89 a lot for what is essentially a tube you squeeze?",
      "honest_answer": "The Viaggio is machined from surgical-grade stainless steel and designed to survive years of travel in bags, backpacks, and pockets. The engineering required to create a reliable manual pressure system at this size is non-trivial. Cheaper alternatives exist, but they are made from plastic and produce lower, less consistent pressure. You get what you pay for."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Should I just buy a portable electric machine instead?",
      "honest_answer": "If you always have access to a power outlet, yes \u2014 the Nano is a better choice for hotel rooms and holiday rentals. The Viaggio exists for the genuinely portable use case: camping, hiking, train journeys, and places where electricity is not guaranteed. If your travel always includes a plug, the Viaggio is romantic but unnecessary."

    "rationale": "If you have access to electricity and want consistency without manual effort, the Nano at \u20ac199 is the smallest electric espresso machine we make."
