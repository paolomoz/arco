  "description_long": "You already have the main rig dialed in. The Primo isn't here to replace it -- it's here for the Tuesday morning when you want a quick shot without warming up the dual boiler, or the guest setup when friends come over and you don't want them near your profiling machine. The 58mm group head takes the same commercial baskets and accessories you already own. PID-controlled temperature means the shots are respectable, not just convenient. And the thermoblock heat-up time means it's pulling shots while your main machine is still warming its boiler. For the price, it's the most useful second machine in the lineup.",
  "use_case_headline": "The weekday workhorse for your coffee station.",
  "use_case_body": "Same 58mm baskets as your main setup. PID-controlled thermoblock. 90-second ready time. The Primo gives you a credible shot without the 20-minute boiler warm-up -- perfect for mornings when speed matters more than profiling.",
