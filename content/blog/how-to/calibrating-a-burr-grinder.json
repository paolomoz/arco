  "intro": "Every burr grinder has a zero point — the setting where the burrs just barely touch. Finding and verifying this reference is the foundation of grinder calibration. If your zero point has drifted, every grind setting you use is slightly off. Here is how to recalibrate and why it matters more than you think.",

      "heading": "What the Zero Point Is and Why It Drifts",
      "content": "The zero point of a burr grinder is the grind setting at which the upper and lower burrs make contact across their entire cutting surface. It is the finest possible setting — finer than you would ever brew with — and it serves as the reference from which all other grind sizes are measured. When you set your grinder to a specific number or mark, you are really saying 'this many increments coarser than zero.' If zero itself has moved, every setting above it shifts by the same amount, and your recipes no longer correspond to the particle size they used to produce. Zero point drift happens for several reasons. The most common is burr wear. As the cutting edges dull over years of use, the effective gap between burrs at any given setting widens slightly. The burrs physically get thinner, so the same dial position produces a coarser grind. Another cause is loosening of the adjustment mechanism — vibration from the motor can slowly back off the calibration collar or shift an inner burr carrier. Temperature changes can also cause minor thermal expansion in the burr housing. On the Arco Preciso and Arco Zero, the adjustment mechanism is designed to resist drift with a spring-loaded detent system, but even these benefit from a periodic zero-point check, especially after cleaning or reassembling the burr set."

      "heading": "Finding the Zero Point Safely",
      "content": "Before you begin, make sure the grinder is completely empty — no beans in the hopper, no grounds in the chamber. Running burrs together with coffee between them will produce a false zero point because the coffee acts as a spacer. Remove the hopper, brush out any remaining beans, and run the grinder briefly to clear the burr chamber. Now, with the grinder powered off, slowly turn the grind adjustment toward the finer end. On the Arco Preciso, this means rotating the stepless collar clockwise. On the Arco Zero, turn the adjustment ring inward. Go slowly and listen carefully. When you feel a slight resistance and hear a faint scraping or chirping sound, the burrs are touching — you have found zero. Do not force past this point. Burr-to-burr contact under motor power can damage cutting edges, which is why you should always find zero with the motor off. Some people prefer to turn the motor on at the lowest speed and approach zero gradually, stopping the instant they hear the chirp. This method works but carries slightly more risk of damage if you overshoot. The manual method with the motor off is safer and accurate enough for home use. Mark this position on the adjustment dial or collar — on the Arco Preciso, align the index line with zero. This is your new reference."

      "heading": "Verifying Burr Alignment",
      "content": "Finding zero is also an opportunity to check burr alignment. Ideally, the burrs should touch simultaneously across their entire surface when you reach zero. If one side touches first — indicated by chirping that starts at one point and gets louder as you go finer — the burrs are slightly tilted relative to each other. Minor misalignment is common and not catastrophic, but it means one side of the burr set is grinding finer than the other, producing a wider particle distribution than the burrs are capable of at optimal alignment. On the Arco Zero, which is designed for user-serviceable alignment, you can adjust this using the three alignment screws on the upper burr carrier. Loosen all three screws slightly, bring the burrs to zero, and gently tighten each screw while listening for even contact. The goal is to hear the chirp appear uniformly rather than from one spot first. This process takes patience — expect to go through three or four adjustment cycles before you are satisfied. On the Arco Preciso, the factory alignment is set with precision gauges and should not need user adjustment under normal use. If you suspect misalignment after years of use or after a drop, contact Arco support for a burr re-alignment service. Attempting to adjust fixed-alignment grinders without proper tools can make things worse."

      "heading": "Translating Calibration into Better Coffee",
      "content": "Once you have verified zero and confirmed alignment, back off the adjustment to your espresso range and pull a test shot. You may find that your old grind setting now produces a different result — this is expected if the zero point had drifted. Re-dial in using the method from our dial-in guide: fix dose and yield, adjust grind by taste. The shots you pull after calibration should have noticeably better clarity and sweetness, because the burrs are now producing a tighter particle distribution at the correct reference point. How often should you recalibrate? For home use with the Arco Preciso or Zero, a zero-point check every three to six months is sufficient unless you notice a sudden change in shot behavior that does not respond to normal grind adjustments. If you clean the burrs — which you should do every few months by removing them and brushing away accumulated fines and oils — always re-verify zero before using the grinder again, because reassembly can shift the burr position by a fraction. Think of calibration as the grinder equivalent of tuning a guitar. The instrument still plays when it is slightly out of tune, and you might not notice in casual use. But when you tune it properly and play the same chord, the difference in resonance and clarity is unmistakable."
