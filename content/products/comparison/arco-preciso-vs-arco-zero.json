  "comparison_intro": "The Preciso is already a serious grinder that satisfies most home baristas. The Zero pushes into competition territory with larger burrs, true zero retention, and a particle distribution that brings out nuance most setups can't resolve. The honest question is whether your palate and machine can tell the difference.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Preciso and Arco Zero grinders on a dark slate surface, the Zero noticeably taller and heavier, a refractometer and cupping spoon nearby suggesting advanced technique, shallow depth of field focusing on the burr adjustment collars, moody ambient lighting",

      "rationale": "If you own a Studio or Studio Pro and regularly taste the difference between grind adjustments, the Zero's larger burrs and tighter distribution will give you clarity the Preciso can't match."

  "verdict": "The Preciso is one of the best values in home espresso grinding and will satisfy most baristas for years. The Zero is for the subset of people who have trained their palate, invested in a capable machine, and want the grinder to stop being the limiting factor. If you are pairing with a Doppio, the Preciso is the right choice. If you own a Studio or Studio Pro and take extraction seriously, the Zero completes the setup.",
