            <h1>The upgrade your mornings have been waiting for.</h1>
            <p>If your current machine leaves you wanting more, the Primo's commercial-grade 58mm group head and PID temperature control deliver the shot quality that entry-level machines simply can't.</p>

      <p>You've outgrown your first machine. Maybe the shots are inconsistent, or the plasticky portafilter never feels quite right, or you've started noticing temperature swings mid-pull. The Arco Primo solves all of that. Its PID-controlled thermoblock holds temperature within a degree of your target, the full-size 58mm group head accepts commercial baskets and accessories, and the 15-bar pump delivers a stable 9 bar at the group -- the pressure that actually matters. This isn't a lateral move. It's the step up that makes every shot noticeably, undeniably better.</p>

      <h2>Why the Primo outperforms what you have now.</h2>
      <p>Commercial 58mm portafilter compatibility means better baskets, better accessories, and better extraction. PID temperature control eliminates the guesswork. And at this price point, the Primo gives you prosumer fundamentals without the prosumer price tag.</p>

            <p>I came from a Delonghi and the difference was immediate. Real portafilter, actual temperature stability, and crema I didn't think was possible at home. Should have done this a year ago.</p>
