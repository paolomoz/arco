  "description_long": "The Arco Nano was designed around a single question: what is the smallest machine that can produce genuinely good espresso? The answer is 20 cm tall, heats up in 60 seconds, and uses a 53mm portafilter that produces balanced, full-bodied shots. The thermoblock system is efficient and responsive, and the 0.8L tank lasts a full weekend of double shots. Whether you live in a studio apartment, want espresso at the office, or need a second machine for a small space, the Nano proves that constraints inspire better design.",
