      <p>The Primo is where most people start their espresso journey, and it does that job beautifully. The Doppio is where you land when you want temperature stability, simultaneous steaming, and the kind of consistency that makes you stop blaming the beans.</p>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>If you drink straight espresso and value speed above all else, the Primo is an excellent machine that will serve you well for years. But if you have started to notice inconsistency in your shots, want to make milk drinks without the wait, or simply want room to grow, the Doppio is the smarter long-term investment. The price gap is real, but so is the daily difference in workflow.</p>
