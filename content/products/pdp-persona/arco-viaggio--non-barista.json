  "description_long": "If the idea of an espresso machine makes you nervous, the Viaggio will put you at ease. There are no dials, no settings, no digital displays. Here's all you do: heat water in a kettle, put ground coffee in the basket, pour in the hot water, and press the lever down slowly. That's it. The lever does the work of a pump -- you just push. In about 30 seconds, you have a real espresso. Use ESE pods if you want zero mess and zero measuring, or pre-ground espresso coffee from the supermarket for the lowest possible cost. The Viaggio cleans up in seconds under running water, stores in a drawer, and doesn't require any expertise whatsoever. It's the least intimidating path to genuine espresso that exists.",
