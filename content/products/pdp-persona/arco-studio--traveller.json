  "description_long": "You've stood at bars in Rome, sipped single-origins in Melbourne, queued for shots in Tokyo. Your palate doesn't settle for ordinary. The Studio was built for exactly this -- a home machine that produces espresso worthy of the best specialty cafes you've visited around the world. The saturated group head and flow profiling let you coax out the nuanced flavours of the single-origin beans you bring back from your travels. Dual stainless boilers mean milk drinks are just as good as straight shots. And the build quality -- precision-machined stainless steel, walnut accents, a pressure gauge that's as beautiful as it is functional -- means this machine becomes the anchor of a home that's as considered as the places you've been. When you're away, you'll miss it.",
