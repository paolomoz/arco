            <h1>Is the Arco Nano right for you?</h1>
            <p>The Nano is our smallest electric espresso machine. It makes real espresso in very little space with very little fuss. But small means trade-offs, and we want you to understand them before you buy.</p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You live in a studio apartment or have a galley kitchen where every centimetre of counter space is contested territory.</li>
        <li>You drink black espresso exclusively and don't need a steam wand capable of latte art.</li>
        <li>You want the fastest possible heat-up time in our range — 45 seconds from cold to ready.</li>
        <li>You are looking for a secondary machine for a home office, a holiday house, or a bedroom side table that happens to make real espresso.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Not Ideal For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You want to develop barista skills over time — the 54 mm portafilter limits your accessory and basket options compared to the industry-standard 58 mm.</li>
        <li>You care about milk texture — the Panarello wand produces passable froth but not the microfoam needed for latte art or silky cappuccinos.</li>
        <li>You plan to make espresso for more than two people regularly — the small water tank and compact thermoblock need recovery time between back-to-back shots.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div>
          <div>Is it just a toy or does it make real espresso?</div>
          <div>It makes real espresso. The extraction physics are the same as any other pump machine — 9 bar of pressure through finely ground coffee. Blind taste tests consistently show the Nano holding its own against machines twice its size. Where it falls short is workflow flexibility, not cup quality.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Should I spend the extra €100 for the Primo instead?</div>
          <div>If you have the counter space, probably yes. The Primo's 58 mm portafilter, better steam system, and broader accessory compatibility make it the stronger long-term choice. The Nano wins only when space is the primary constraint — but when space is the constraint, it wins decisively.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Can I travel with it?</div>
          <div>It is small enough to bring to a holiday rental, but it still needs mains power and a stable surface. If you want espresso on the road — camping, hotel rooms, actual travel — the Viaggio is what you need. The Nano is portable-ish, not truly portable.</div>
