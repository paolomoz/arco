  "description_long": "You want great coffee. You don't want to learn how to make it. The Automatico understands. It has a built-in conical burr grinder, an automatic milk system, and a touchscreen with eight programmable drinks -- espresso, lungo, cappuccino, latte, flat white, and more. You fill the bean hopper, fill the water tank, and press the icon for whatever you feel like drinking. The machine grinds the beans, tamps the coffee, extracts the shot, and froths the milk. Then it runs its own cleaning cycle. That's it. That's the entire experience. No portafilters, no tamping, no temperature surfing, no jargon. Just consistently excellent coffee that happens to be made from freshly ground beans -- which is why it tastes dramatically better than pods, instant, or drip. You don't need to understand why. You just need to taste it.",
