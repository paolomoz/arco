  "headline": "Great espresso. No barista skills required.",
  "subheadline": "The Arco Primo was designed for people who love good coffee but have zero interest in becoming a hobbyist. It's genuinely simple -- and the espresso is genuinely excellent.",
  "hero_image_alt": "Arco Primo espresso machine in matte white on a bright modern kitchen counter, a person casually holding a finished espresso with a relaxed smile, warm inviting atmosphere with no clutter or tools visible",
  "description_long": "Let's be honest: most espresso machines are intimidating. The Arco Primo isn't. It heats up in 90 seconds, uses a standard portafilter that's easy to load, and has exactly two buttons -- one for a single shot, one for a double. That's it. No pressure gauges to interpret, no steaming wands to master, no grind settings to agonize over. The included quick-start guide walks you through your first shot in under five minutes, and by the third morning you'll be doing it on autopilot. You don't need to become a barista to drink like one.",
  "use_case_headline": "Coffee you'll be proud of, with nothing to learn.",
  "use_case_body": "The Primo ships with everything you need: portafilter, baskets, tamper, and a step-by-step quick-start guide. Pair it with pre-ground espresso coffee or the Arco Macinino grinder, and you're making cafe-quality espresso from day one.",
