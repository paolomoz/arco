      <h1>The Upgrade Path</h1>

      <p>You have been making espresso at home for a while now. You have learned to dial in, you know what channeling looks like through a bottomless portafilter, and you have started noticing the difference between a good shot and a great one. The starter machine that served you well is beginning to feel like a ceiling. You are ready for more control, more consistency, and more room to grow.</p>
      <p>The Upgrade Path is for the home barista in transition. You have outgrown the basics but are not yet ready to build a full commercial-grade home bar. You want meaningful improvements that translate directly to better coffee in the cup, not features for their own sake. This is about thoughtful investment: choosing equipment that will serve you for years, not months, and that rewards your growing skill with measurably better results.</p>
      <p>The foundation of this setup is the Arco Doppio, a dual-boiler machine that eliminates the single biggest frustration of entry-level equipment: waiting. With independent boilers for brewing and steaming, you can pull a shot and froth milk simultaneously, and both temperatures remain rock-solid throughout. Pair it with the Arco Macinino, whose digital dose control and anti-static system deliver repeatable grinds with minimal waste, and add the Arco Precision Scale to bring data-driven discipline to your workflow. Together, these three pieces give you the control you have been craving without the complexity of a professional setup.</p>
