            <h1>Is the Arco Doppio right for you?</h1>
            <p>The Doppio is where most people land when they outgrow their first machine. It solves the two biggest complaints about entry-level espresso — temperature inconsistency and the wait between brewing and steaming. But it also asks more of you than a simpler machine does.</p>

      <h2>Perfect For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You have been using a single-boiler machine for six months or more and are tired of temperature surfing and waiting between shots and steaming.</li>
        <li>You make milk drinks daily and want to brew and steam at the same time without compromise.</li>
        <li>You have developed enough technique to appreciate PID temperature control but don't need pressure profiling yet.</li>
        <li>You want a machine that pairs well with a stepless grinder and gives you room to grow for several years.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Not Ideal For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are brand new to espresso and haven't yet learned basic workflow — the Doppio's adjustable OPV and dual PID are wasted if you are still learning to tamp consistently.</li>
        <li>You are already experimenting with pressure profiling or flow control — the Doppio doesn't offer pre-infusion or profiling, and you will feel limited quickly.</li>
        <li>You want a machine that heats up in under a minute — the dual boilers need 3 minutes, which is fast for this class but slow compared to a thermoblock.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <div class="accordion">
        <div>
          <div>Is the jump from €299 to €549 worth it?</div>
          <div>If you drink straight espresso only and never make milk drinks, the Primo might still be enough for you. The Doppio's biggest advantages are simultaneous brew/steam, PID stability, and the adjustable OPV. If any of those matter to your daily routine, the €250 gap pays for itself in the first month of better mornings.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Should I skip the Doppio and go straight to the Studio?</div>
          <div>Only if you are confident you will use pre-infusion control and can commit to an 8-minute warm-up. The Doppio is not a compromise — it is a genuinely excellent machine with a faster warm-up and less operational complexity. Many experienced baristas use dual-boiler machines like the Doppio as their daily driver.</div>

        <div>
          <div>Can it handle hosting — making coffee for four or five guests?</div>
          <div>Yes, comfortably. The dual boiler system means you don't have to wait between shots and steaming, and the 2-litre water tank handles multiple drinks without refilling. It is not an office machine, but it handles a dinner party with ease.</div>
