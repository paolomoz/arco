            <h1>One cup between the alarm and the 7:42.</h1>
            <p>The train will not wait. Your coffee should not make you late.</p>

      <p>Your morning runs on a schedule that is not yours. The train leaves at 7:42. The walk to the station takes eleven minutes. Breakfast, shower, dressing — all of it is reverse-engineered from that departure time. The coffee has to fit inside the gaps, and it does, because you have made it fit.</p>

      <p>You have a theory about commuter mornings that you have never shared with anyone because it would sound obsessive if you said it out loud. The theory is this: every minute before you leave the house has a job, and the quality of your day depends on how well each minute does its job. The shower wakes you up. Getting dressed makes you human. Breakfast provides energy. And coffee — one single espresso, drunk standing at the counter — provides the psychological transition between being at home and being in the world.

Without the coffee, you walk to the station feeling incomplete. You have tested this. On mornings when you skip it — because you overslept, because you could not find your keys, because the boiler was not on — the day starts with a deficit that no takeaway cup from the station kiosk can fill. Station coffee is hot, it contains caffeine, but it is not yours. It was not made by your hands in your kitchen. The ritual matters as much as the substance.

The Arco Nano was bought specifically for this life. You did not need a dual boiler or a steam wand or programmable pre-infusion profiles. You needed a machine that heats up in forty seconds, pulls a clean double shot in twenty-five, and takes up less counter space than a kettle. The Nano does exactly this and nothing more, and its restraint is the reason it works.

Your workflow is automatic now. Alarm at 6:55. Nano on at 7:01, immediately after stepping out of the shower. Dressed by 7:08. Beans ground — you pre-dose the night before, but grind in the morning because even you, with your abbreviated routine, can taste the difference between fresh-ground and pre-ground. The grind takes twelve seconds. Tamp, lock in, press the button.

By 7:12, you are standing at the counter with an espresso. You drink it slowly — or as slowly as four minutes allow. This is the part that matters. Not the speed but the attention. For four minutes, you are not checking email, not scanning the news, not calculating whether you can catch the earlier train if you walk faster. You are tasting coffee. Feeling the warmth in your hands. Watching the crema thin and disperse.

Then it is over. Cup rinsed, portafilter emptied, coat on, keys in hand, door closed. The walk to the station is brisk but not rushed, because four minutes of standing still with a good espresso has recalibrated your pace. You arrive on the platform at 7:40 with two minutes to spare, which is the exact margin you have designed the morning around.

On the train, you think about the coffee. Not analytically — you are not a person who takes tasting notes — but with a quiet satisfaction. The shot was good today. There was a sweetness in it that you noticed, a caramel edge that came from the medium roast you are working through this week. Tomorrow you might try the slightly darker one. The variation is small, but it gives each morning a texture that would be absent if every day were identical.

People at the office drink from paper cups they picked up at the chain on the corner. The coffee is adequate and anonymous, the same in every city, every country. They do not understand why you bother making your own when the station is right there. But you know. It is not about the coffee being better, though it is. It is about the four minutes. About starting the day with something deliberately chosen, precisely made, and entirely your own.

The Nano sits on the counter all day while you are gone, small and dark and patient. When you come home, you do not make another coffee. One is enough. That is the other thing the commuter morning has taught you — that limits, when chosen well, are a form of discipline that makes the single thing inside them more valuable.

One cup. One good cup. That is the whole morning.</p>
