  "description_long": "There's something deeply satisfying about making espresso with your hands. The Viaggio strips the morning ritual down to its most elemental form: hot water, ground coffee, and the slow press of a lever. No buttons to press, no machines humming, no screens glowing. Just the quiet resistance of the lever, the steady build of pressure, and then -- a rich, concentrated espresso that you built entirely by feel. At 1.2 kg, it stores in a drawer or on a shelf, leaving your counter completely clear. Clean-up takes thirty seconds under running water. For the minimalist who wants their morning ritual to be intentional and physical, the Viaggio is espresso at its most honest.",

  "use_case_body": "Boil water. Load the basket. Press the lever slowly. The Viaggio takes about 90 seconds from start to finish, produces zero counter clutter, and cleans up in half a minute. It's the most calming way to start a morning.",
