            <h1>The practical starter. No apologies needed.</h1>
            <p>Under five hundred euros is where home espresso gets genuinely good. You can afford a proper machine, a proper grinder, and still have money left for beans. This is the budget where daily espresso stops feeling like a project and starts feeling like a habit.</p>

      <p>At this price point, two combinations stand out. The first is the Arco Primo (€299) paired with the Arco Macinino (€129), which totals €428 and leaves room for accessories or a bag of specialty beans. The second is the Arco Nano (€199) with the Macinino, coming in at €328 with significant headroom.

The Primo and Macinino is the combination we recommend most often for a reason. The Primo's thermoblock heats up in 90 seconds, its 58mm portafilter accepts commercial baskets and accessories, and the build quality suggests a machine that costs considerably more. The Macinino's twenty stepped settings are forgiving and repeatable — you find your grind, mark the number, and produce consistent grounds every morning without thinking about it.

The Nano is the right choice if counter space is genuinely limited or if the recipient has never made espresso before. Its 53mm portafilter is slightly smaller, and the pressurised basket option means acceptable results even with imperfect technique. It is a bridge — good enough to produce real espresso today, affordable enough that upgrading later does not feel like a waste.

What you are giving up at this budget is temperature precision, steam power, and simultaneous brewing and steaming. The Primo is a single-boiler machine, which means you brew first and steam second. For straight espresso, this is irrelevant. For milk drinks, it adds about sixty seconds to your workflow. The Macinino's stepped adjustment means you cannot micro-tune between settings the way a stepless grinder allows — but for the Primo's forgiving brew temperature, this rarely matters in practice.

This is the tier where the morning espresso habit becomes sustainable. The coffee is good. The workflow is fast. The investment is sensible.</p>
