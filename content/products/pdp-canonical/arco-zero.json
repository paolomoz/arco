  "description_long": "The Arco Zero is a single-dose grinder built on a simple principle: what goes in must come out. Its 64mm titanium-coated flat burrs produce an exceptionally uniform particle distribution with virtually zero retention — weigh your beans in, and the same weight comes out as ground coffee. The bellows purge clears the last fraction of a gram from the grinding chamber, ensuring that every shot represents only the beans you chose for it. Stepless micrometric adjustment, a low-RPM motor that minimises heat transfer, and an anti-static outlet complete a grinder that leaves nothing to chance. The Zero is not the grinder for everyone. It is the grinder for people who measure everything.",
