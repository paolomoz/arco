  "description_long": "If you brew both filter and espresso, you've probably been using your espresso grinder for everything and accepting the compromise at the coarser end. The Filtro approaches it from the other direction -- calibrated for filter, but with enough range and precision to handle espresso. The 48mm flat burrs and 30-step clicked adjustment give you exact repeatability across methods: step 8 for espresso, step 18 for V60, step 24 for French press. Mark your settings, switch in seconds, and return with confidence. The clicked mechanism eliminates the dial drift that plagues stepless grinders when switching between fine and coarse. At its price point, the Filtro gives you a genuinely capable multi-method grinder that excels at filter -- where dedicated espresso grinders typically struggle. If you're tired of compromising on your pour-overs while your espresso grinder sits at settings it wasn't designed for, the Filtro is the upgrade that covers both bases.",

    "quote": "I was using my Niche Zero for everything and my V60s were always a bit muddy. The Filtro fixed that instantly -- proper filter-calibrated burrs that actually work at coarser settings. And surprisingly, it handles espresso well enough that I use it for both. Best value grinder I've owned.",
