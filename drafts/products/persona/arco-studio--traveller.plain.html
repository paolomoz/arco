            <h1>The home machine that makes you stop missing cafes abroad.</h1>
            <p>You've tasted the best espresso the world has to offer. The Studio is the machine that finally matches it -- so coming home feels like arriving, not settling.</p>

      <p>You've stood at bars in Rome, sipped single-origins in Melbourne, queued for shots in Tokyo. Your palate doesn't settle for ordinary. The Studio was built for exactly this -- a home machine that produces espresso worthy of the best specialty cafes you've visited around the world. The saturated group head and flow profiling let you coax out the nuanced flavours of the single-origin beans you bring back from your travels. Dual stainless boilers mean milk drinks are just as good as straight shots. And the build quality -- precision-machined stainless steel, walnut accents, a pressure gauge that's as beautiful as it is functional -- means this machine becomes the anchor of a home that's as considered as the places you've been. When you're away, you'll miss it.</p>

      <h2>A world-class espresso bar in your own kitchen.</h2>
      <p>Bring back single-origin beans from your travels and dial them in with the Studio's flow profiling and precise temperature control. The saturated group head extracts the same nuanced flavours you tasted at origin. Your home espresso finally matches your passport.</p>

            <p>I used to think home espresso couldn't match what I'd had in specialty cafes around the world. The Studio proved me wrong. I brought back a washed Ethiopian from a farm visit in Sidama and dialed it in with the flow profiler -- it tasted exactly like the cupping at origin. Extraordinary.</p>
