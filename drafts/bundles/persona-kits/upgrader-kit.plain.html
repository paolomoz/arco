            <h1>You've outgrown your setup. This is what comes next.</h1>
            <p>The Upgrader Kit is built for the home barista who has been pulling shots for a while and knows — instinctively, frustratingly — that their equipment is now the ceiling. This bundle removes that ceiling.</p>

      <p>There is a moment in every home barista's journey that feels like a wall. Your technique has improved, you are buying better beans, you understand the basics of dose and yield — and yet the shots are inconsistent. Some mornings the espresso sings. Other mornings it is thin, or bitter, or just flat. The frustrating truth is that you have probably reached the limit of your equipment, not your skill. The Upgrader Kit addresses both sides of the extraction equation simultaneously. The Doppio's dual boilers hold brew temperature within one degree Celsius, so the variable that caused yesterday's sour shot and today's bitter one simply disappears. The Preciso's stepless adjustment lets you make grind changes so small they would be impossible on a stepped grinder — changes that translate directly into flavour clarity in the cup. The distribution tool and precision scale are not luxuries at this level; they are the tools that let you repeat a good shot reliably rather than stumbling into one occasionally. This is the setup that turns intuition into understanding.</p>
