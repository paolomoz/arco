            <h1>48mm conicals tuned for flavour clarity on medium-dark roasts.</h1>
            <p>The Preciso isn't trying to be a flat-burr competitor. It's a purpose-built conical grinder that excels where conicals should: sweetness, body, and a forgiving extraction window on traditional and medium-dark profiles.</p>

      <p>You already know the flat-vs-conical debate, so here's where the Preciso lands: 48mm steel conical burrs running at 600 RPM, producing a bimodal distribution that naturally emphasises sweetness and body. This makes it exceptional for medium to dark roasts where you want round, chocolatey flavours without the aggressive clarity of a unimodal flat profile. The 40-step macro adjustment with continuous micro dial gives you enough precision to dial in origin-specific profiles without the finicky overshoot of a fully stepless mechanism. Retention at under 0.8 grams is respectable -- not single-dose territory, but with a quick purge you're within half a gram. The 250g hopper supports a hopper-flow workflow for daily use. If your rotation includes traditional Italian blends, natural-process Brazils, or anything in the medium-dark spectrum, the Preciso is a dedicated tool that does exactly what conicals do best.</p>

      <h2>The conical specialist for traditional profiles.</h2>
      <p>Bimodal distribution for sweetness and body. 600 RPM for low heat generation. 40-step macro + micro for precise, repeatable adjustment. If you grind medium-dark roasts for traditional espresso, the Preciso is purpose-built for your workflow.</p>

            <p>I use the Zero for light single-origins and the Preciso for my daily Italian blend. The conical profile is exactly right for medium-dark -- sweet, full-bodied, with none of the harsh clarity that my flat burrs produce on darker roasts. It knows what it is.</p>
