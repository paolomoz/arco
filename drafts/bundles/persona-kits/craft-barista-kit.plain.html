            <h1>For the person who treats every extraction as a conversation.</h1>
            <p>The Craft Barista Kit brings together Arco's most capable espresso machine and grinder with the preparation tools that serious baristas consider non-negotiable. This is a complete station, built for intention.</p>

      <p>The craft barista does not pull shots. They conduct extractions — adjusting variables, reading feedback, and refining until the cup in front of them expresses exactly what the roaster intended. This kit is the workshop for that practice. The Studio's E61 group head is the most proven design in espresso history, and for good reason: the brass thermosyphon circuit delivers a gentle pre-infusion that naturally smooths the opening seconds of extraction, buying forgiveness for minor puck preparation inconsistencies while rewarding precision when you get everything right. The Zero grinder completes the equation. Its 64mm flat burrs produce a particle distribution tight enough to make single-origin light roasts taste clean rather than sour, and true zero retention means every gram you weigh in is every gram that reaches the portafilter. Between them, the WDT tool, dosing cup, and graduated shot glasses close the remaining gaps in the workflow. No step is left to chance, but none of it feels like work — because for the craft barista, this attention is the point.</p>
