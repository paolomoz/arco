Our preparation range includes everything between the grinder and the cup: calibrated tampers that apply consistent pressure every time, WDT distribution tools that eliminate channelling, precision scales that read to 0.1 grams with built-in shot timers, double-walled ceramic cups that keep espresso at temperature, and stainless steel milk pitchers with pour-optimised spouts. Every piece is designed to integrate with Arco machines and with each other — same materials, same proportions, same quiet confidence. These are not add-ons. They are the details that close the gap between a good shot and a great one.",
