  "intro": "Two coffees from the same farm, the same variety, picked on the same day — but processed differently — can taste like entirely different beverages. Processing is the bridge between the cherry on the tree and the green bean in the roaster's hands, and the choices made during this stage shape the cup as profoundly as origin or roast level. Here is what each method does and why it matters for your brewing.",

      "heading": "Washed Process: Clarity and Terroir",
      "content": "Washed processing, also called wet processing, is the standard method for most specialty coffee and the one that best reveals the intrinsic qualities of the bean itself — its terroir, variety, and altitude. The steps are straightforward in principle but demanding in execution. After picking, the outer skin and pulp of the cherry are mechanically removed by a depulping machine, leaving the bean covered in a thin layer of sticky mucilage. The beans are then placed in fermentation tanks filled with water for twelve to seventy-two hours, depending on the producer's protocol and the ambient temperature. During fermentation, naturally occurring microbes break down the mucilage until it can be washed away with clean water. The beans are then spread on raised drying beds or concrete patios and dried slowly over one to three weeks until they reach a moisture content of around eleven percent. The critical point about washed processing is what it removes. By stripping away all fruit material before drying, the washed method eliminates the fermented-fruit flavours that characterise natural coffees. What remains in the cup is a clean expression of the bean's inherent character: the acidity imparted by altitude, the sweetness developed during maturation, the aromatic complexity encoded in the variety's genetics. Washed coffees are typically described as bright, clean, and transparent. They tend to have higher perceived acidity and a lighter body compared to the same coffee processed naturally. This makes washed coffees ideal for filter brewing, where clarity is the whole point. A washed Kenyan SL-28 brewed through a V60 can produce a cup with laser-sharp blackcurrant acidity and a juicy, almost citrus-like finish that feels like tasting the altitude."

      "heading": "Natural Process: Fruit and Fermentation",
      "content": "Natural processing, also called dry processing, is the oldest method of preparing coffee and remains the dominant approach in Ethiopia and parts of Brazil. Instead of removing the fruit before drying, natural coffees are dried with the entire cherry intact. The picked cherries are spread on raised beds or patios and turned regularly over two to four weeks as they slowly dehydrate under the sun. During this extended contact, the fruit ferments around the bean, and sugars and flavour compounds from the cherry migrate into the seed. The result is a cup with dramatically more fruit character, body, and sweetness than a washed version of the same coffee. Well-processed naturals can taste like blueberry jam, tropical fruit, red wine, or dark chocolate — rich, layered, and sometimes almost syrupy in texture. Ethiopian natural coffees from Guji or Sidamo are legendary for their explosive berry and stone-fruit notes, which can be so vivid they surprise people who associate coffee only with roasted, nutty flavours. The risk with natural processing is inconsistency. Because the whole cherry is drying as a single unit, uneven drying can produce off-flavours: fermented, boozy, vinegary, or musty notes that indicate the fruit decomposed rather than fermented cleanly. Skilled producers mitigate this by sorting cherries meticulously at picking, turning them frequently on the drying beds, and monitoring moisture levels constantly. The difference between a clean natural and a defective one is entirely down to the care and infrastructure at the farm or washing station. For espresso, natural coffees can be extraordinary. The fruit sweetness and body amplify beautifully under pressure, producing shots with a syrupy mouthfeel and lingering fruity finish. For filter, naturals work well in immersion methods like French Press and AeroPress, where the heavier body and fruit notes are assets rather than distractions."

      "heading": "Honey Process: The Middle Ground",
      "content": "Honey processing — widely practised in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and increasingly across Central America — is a deliberate hybrid of washed and natural methods. The outer skin is removed by depulping, just as in washed processing, but some or all of the mucilage is intentionally left on the bean during drying. The amount of mucilage retained determines the honey subcategory: white and yellow honey have less mucilage (quicker drying, lighter fruit influence), red honey retains more, and black honey keeps nearly all of it (slowest drying, most fruit character). As the mucilage-coated beans dry on raised beds, the sugars in the mucilage caramelise and bond with the bean's surface. This imparts a sweetness and body that sits between the clean brightness of a washed coffee and the fruity intensity of a natural. Honey-processed coffees often present stone fruit, brown sugar, maple, and a rounded, almost creamy mouthfeel that many people find immediately appealing. The process requires careful management because the sticky mucilage is a magnet for mould and uneven fermentation. Producers must turn the beans frequently and monitor drying conditions closely, making honey processing labour-intensive despite appearing simpler than full washed. When executed well, honey coffees offer a compelling balance: enough fruit sweetness to be interesting, enough clarity to let you taste the origin. A red honey Costa Rican on a pour-over can give you a cup with honey-like sweetness, apricot and peach notes, and a clean finish that neither washed nor natural could replicate in quite the same way. For home brewers, honey coffees are versatile — they work beautifully as both espresso and filter, making them a safe choice when you want one bag that performs across multiple brewing methods."

      "heading": "Choosing Process for Espresso vs Filter",
      "content": "Understanding processing allows you to make more intentional choices about which coffees to buy for which brewing method. The general principle is that filter brewing rewards clarity and acidity, while espresso brewing rewards body and sweetness. This means washed coffees are the natural default for filter, and natural or honey coffees often shine as espresso — though there are exceptions worth exploring. For pour-over and drip, washed coffees from high-altitude origins give you the most expressive, complex cups. The clean extraction of a paper filter combined with the clean processing of a washed coffee produces maximum transparency. When you want to taste specific flavour notes — jasmine in an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, blackcurrant in a Kenyan AA, orange blossom in a Panamanian Gesha — washed and filter is the combination that delivers. For espresso, natural coffees add a dimension of fruit sweetness and body that can elevate a shot from good to memorable. A natural Ethiopian pulled as espresso can taste like a blueberry reduction — concentrated, sweet, and complex. Honey coffees are excellent for espresso as well, providing sweetness and body without the occasional wildness of a natural. For milk-based drinks specifically, natural and honey coffees hold their flavour through milk better than most washed coffees, because their heavier body and fruit sweetness cut through the dairy rather than being diluted by it. That said, rules are meant to be tested. A washed Colombian Castillo pulled as a textbook espresso — smooth, caramelly, balanced — is one of the great simple pleasures in coffee. And a well-made natural brewed through a V60 can be a revelatory experience, with fruit notes leaping out of the cup in a way that espresso cannot quite match. The best approach is to let processing guide your expectations while remaining open to surprises."
