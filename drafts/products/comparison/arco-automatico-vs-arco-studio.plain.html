      <p>These two machines sit at similar price points but represent fundamentally different philosophies. The Automatico handles everything from grinding to extraction with one touch. The Studio hands you full control and expects you to learn how to use it. Neither approach is wrong — they serve different people.</p>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>This comparison comes down to a single question: do you enjoy making espresso, or do you enjoy drinking it? If the answer is making, the Studio gives you a lifetime of craft to explore. If the answer is drinking, the Automatico gets out of your way and delivers exceptional coffee with almost no effort. Both are excellent machines — they just respect different priorities.</p>
