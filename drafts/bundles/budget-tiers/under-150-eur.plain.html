            <h1>Real espresso on a real budget. Here is what is possible.</h1>
            <p>A hundred and fifty euros is not a lot of money for an espresso setup, and we are not going to pretend otherwise. But it is enough to make genuinely good espresso if you choose carefully and accept a few honest trade-offs.</p>

      <p>At this price point, you are buying one excellent tool and relying on workarounds for everything else. That tool is the Arco Viaggio — a manual lever espresso maker that produces 9 bars of pressure from your own arm strength, needs no electricity, and at €89 leaves room in the budget for a good bag of beans and a basic hand grinder from any reputable brand.

The Viaggio is not a compromise machine. It is a different category entirely. The espresso it produces has body, crema, and genuine complexity — attributes that many electric machines under €200 struggle to deliver consistently. The trade-off is effort and workflow. You need a separate kettle to heat water. You need to grind your beans before loading the chamber. And the lever press requires a deliberate, steady push that takes a few attempts to learn.

What you are giving up at this budget is convenience and volume. The Viaggio makes one shot at a time. There is no steam wand for milk drinks. There is no programmable temperature or pressure profiling. Your workflow will be slower and more manual than any plug-in machine. But the coffee itself — the liquid in the cup — will be better than what most pod machines and many entry-level electric machines produce.

If you are testing whether home espresso is for you, or if you want a secondary device for travel and weekends, the Viaggio at under €150 is an honest starting point that will not leave you feeling like you wasted your money if you later decide to invest more.</p>
