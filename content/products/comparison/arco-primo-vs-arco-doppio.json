      "recommended_product_id": "arco-doppio",
      "rationale": "The adjustable OPV and dual PID give you the control to actually dial in \u2014 the Primo is a great machine, but it will limit you quickly."
    }
  },
  "verdict": "If you drink straight espresso and value speed above all else, the Primo is an excellent machine that will serve you well for years. But if you have started to notice inconsistency in your shots, want to make milk drinks without the wait, or simply want room to grow, the Doppio is the smarter long-term investment. The price gap is real, but so is the daily difference in workflow.",
