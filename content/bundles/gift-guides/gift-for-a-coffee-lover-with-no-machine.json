          "description": "The Nano is the least intimidating espresso machine Arco makes, and that is deliberate. It heats up in 60 seconds, occupies less counter space than a toaster, and produces shots that will genuinely surprise someone used to instant coffee or capsules. If they live in a small flat or have never expressed interest in 'becoming a barista,' this is the right choice."

It weighs 340 grams, needs no electricity, and makes real espresso using a manual lever. Pair it with a bag of freshly roasted beans and you have given them something they will use on every trip."

Fresh grinding is the single biggest factor in espresso quality, and a good entry-level grinder transforms the experience from 'pretty good' to 'wait, I made this?' Consider the Morning Minimalist Kit for the best value on this combination."
