      <p>Every bag of coffee you buy tells a story that began months before the roaster ever touched the beans. After harvest, coffee cherries must be processed to separate the seed from the fruit. The method chosen at this stage, washed, natural, or honey, has a profound impact on the flavor you taste in your cup. Understanding these processes gives you a vocabulary for describing what you like and a framework for predicting how a coffee might behave in your espresso machine.</p>
      <p>Washed processing, also called wet processing, is the most common method for specialty coffee. The cherry's skin and most of its fruit are removed mechanically within hours of picking. The remaining mucilage is broken down through fermentation in water tanks, then the beans are washed clean and dried on raised beds or patios. Because the fruit is removed early, washed coffees tend to express the character of the bean itself: its varietal qualities, its terroir, its altitude. In the cup, this translates to clarity, brightness, and defined acidity. Washed Ethiopians might taste of lemon blossom and bergamot. Washed Colombians often show caramel, red apple, and a clean finish. For espresso, washed coffees offer precision and transparency, rewarding careful extraction with nuanced, layered shots.</p>
      <p>Natural processing takes the opposite approach. The whole cherry is dried intact, with the fruit still surrounding the seed, on raised beds or concrete patios for two to four weeks. During this extended contact, sugars and acids from the fruit flesh migrate into the bean, producing intense sweetness, heavy body, and bold fruit-forward flavors. A well-processed natural Ethiopian can taste of blueberry jam, tropical fruit, and wine. The risk is that naturals can develop fermented, boozy, or composty off-flavors if the drying is uneven or too slow. In espresso, naturals bring big, sweet, sometimes polarizing character. They are forgiving of slightly coarse grinds and work exceptionally well as the base of espresso blends.</p>
      <p>Honey processing sits between the two. The cherry skin is removed, but some or all of the mucilage is left on the bean during drying. The amount of mucilage retained determines whether the coffee is classified as white, yellow, red, or black honey, with increasing mucilage producing progressively more body and sweetness. Honey-processed coffees often combine the clarity of washed coffees with the sweetness and body of naturals, offering a balanced, approachable profile. Costa Rican and Brazilian honeys are particularly popular for espresso because they deliver crowd-pleasing sweetness without the wild unpredictability of full naturals. No matter which processing method draws you in, the best way to learn is to taste side by side. Buy a washed, a natural, and a honey from the same origin, pull them all as espresso, and let your palate map the differences.</p>
